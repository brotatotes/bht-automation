Matthew 23:28.  But inwardly ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.  ‘Your heart is not a temple of the living God, but a grave of pestilent corruption: not a heaven, but a hell. And your religion is but the whitewash hardly skin-deep’ (Alford). ‘Hypocrisy’ is the whitewash. ‘Iniquity,’ literally ‘lawlessness;’ their outward righteousness was put on, their hearts were really opposed to God’s law. As in the case of the sepulchres, such persons are not only impure themselves but contaminate others; the more easily from the false outward appearance.
