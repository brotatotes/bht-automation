Matthew 23:33.  Ye serpents, ye brood of vipers, etc. Comp. the similar language of John the Baptist (chap. Matthew 3:7). That was the first, and this the last recorded address to the unchanged Pharisees. John had said: ‘who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come,’ our Lord speaks to them, as obdurate:  how shall ye escape the judgment of hell,  i.e.,  the judgment which condemns to hell, Our Lord speaks as Judge.
