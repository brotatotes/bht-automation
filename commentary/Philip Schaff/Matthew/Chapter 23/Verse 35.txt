Two difficulties present themselves: 1 . This person is said to be the son of ‘Jehoiada,’ not of ‘Barachiah.’ But as Jehoiada died at the age of 130 (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ch+24:15">2 Chronicles 24:15</span>), and Zachariah was specially called to be a prophet after his death, the latter was probably a grandson of the former. Matthew, with his usual exactness, inserting the name of the father. Possibly Jehoiada was also called Barachiah. Some think the father’s name an insertion by later copyists, who supposed the reference was to Zachariah the prophet, whose father’s name was Barachiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="zec+1:1">Zechariah 1:1</span>). 2 . This was not the last Old Testament martyr; Urijah was murdered afterwards (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jer+26:23">Jeremiah 26:23</span>). But the book of 2 Chron. stood last in the Hebrew Bible, and the case of Zachariah was a marked one in view of the place ‘between the sanctuary and the altar,’ and of his death-cry: ‘The Lord seeth and will avenge it.’ As regards the application to other persons, we either have no trustworthy record of their martyrdom ( <em> e.g.,</em> Zechariah the prophet, Zacharias the father of John the Baptist), or the death took place after this discourse. Our Lord distinctly refers to what occurred in past generations.
