The reference is not simply to the traditions they added, but also to the mode of presenting the law itself, as demanding a servile obedience in minute details irrespective of the spirit of the commandment. Imposing such burdens, they did not in the least lighten them by spiritual precept or example. Lange: ‘A fourfold rebuke: 1 . they make religion a burden; 2 . an intolerable burden; 3 . they lay it upon the shoulders of others; 4 . they leave it untouched themselves, <em> i.e.</em>, they have no idea of fulfilling these precepts in spirit and in truth.’
