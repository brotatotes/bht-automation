Matthew 23:4.  Yea they bind,  etc. They so presented the correct law as to make its precepts    heavy burdens,  like loads, packs on beasts of burden (comp. Acts 15:16). The reference is not simply to the traditions they added, but also to the mode of presenting the law itself, as demanding a servile obedience in minute details irrespective of the spirit of the commandment. Imposing such burdens, they did not in the least lighten them by spiritual precept or example. Lange: ‘A fourfold rebuke: 1 . they make religion a burden; 2 . an intolerable burden; 3 . they lay it upon the shoulders of others; 4 . they leave it untouched themselves,  i.e., they have no idea of fulfilling these precepts in spirit and in truth.’
