<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:5">Matthew 23:5</span>. <strong> But all their works.</strong> Their extensive routine of duty was not really religious, but performed with this motive: <strong> to be seen of men.</strong> Self-righteousness rests on pride, and, inevitably becoming exhibitional, betrays its origin.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> For they make broad their phylacteries.</strong> Small slips of parchment, on which passages from the law were written, usually worn at time of prayer on the left arm and the forehead. (The custom was derived from a literal understanding of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:16">Exodus 13:16</span>, and the passages inscribed were four in number: <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:2-10">Exodus 12:2-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:11-21">Exodus 13:11-21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+6:4-9">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+11:18-21">Deuteronomy 11:18-21</span>.) The name, from the Greek word meaning to ‘guard,’ was probably suggested by the command of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:10">Exodus 13:10</span>, where this word occurs. Afterwards the idea of a charm or amulet guarding from danger naturally came in. Making them broad probably refers to the case in which the parchment was kept. The latter was of a prescribed size, as indeed nearly everything connected with their use had been made a matter of Rabbinical rule. As our Lord does not condemn the practice itself, but only its abuse, it has been inferred that He Himself used phylacteries; but this cannot be proven. It is said that the Pharisees wore them constantly, but the common people only at prayers. The accompanying cut shows how they were worn as frontlets. When used on the left arm, the leather thong was made into a little knot of peculiar shape (like the Hebrew letter <em> Yod)</em> near the bend of the arm, and then wound in a spiral line round the arm and to the end of the middle finger. The minute regulations in regard to phylacteries form a curious confirmation of the belittling tendency of formalism. Similar external badges of professed religious feeling have been used in all ages, from the same motives and with the same tendency.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Enlarge the borders of their garments.</strong> ‘Of their garments’ is not found in the correct text, but is necessarily understood. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="nu+15:38">Numbers 15:38</span>, the Israelites were bidden to wear fringes about their outer garment, fastened to it with a blue ribbon, to distinguish them from other nations, and to remind them of their duty to obey the law. The usage may have existed before that passage attached a symbolical meaning to it. The fringe may have been the ordinary mode of preventing the edge of the robe from unravelling, and the blue ribbon was useful in strengthening the border. The Pharisees, as sticklers for the rigid observance of the law, made these fringes larger than others. All these external badges had proper symbolical meanings. Lange: ‘Blue was the symbolical color of heaven, the color of God, of His covenant, and of faithfulness to that covenant. The tassels themselves signified flowers, or birds; probably pomegranates, and these crimson, and not blue, as the ribbons were. Thus they were remembrancers that fidelity to the covenant should flourish; or they were tokens that the flower of life was love, and that love must spring from faithfulness to the covenant.’ But the Pharisees, however significant their ritualism, murdered Him to whom it pointed. It is a short step from religious pageantry to religious pride. Canstein: ‘Pharisaic folly; elegant Bibles and books of prayer, and no devotion in the heart.’
