Matthew 23:6.  The chief place at feasts. The place on the middle couch at the upper table (which joined the other two) was considered most honorable.
	 Chief seats in the synagogues. The places nearest the reading desk, where the elders sat. Being in such places (at feasts, in synagogues or elsewhere) is not rebuked, but  loving to be there. Pharisaism may now show itself in taking the lowest place, if this is done in a slavish obedience to the letter of the gospel, or from a desire to be invited to go up higher.
