Matthew 23:8.  But be not ye called Rabbi. But this prohibition includes all the manifestations of religious pride spoken of, since it prohibits the pride itself.
	 For one is your Master, or, ‘Teacher.’ The word ‘Christ’ is to be omitted here. Because One is our Teacher, all are our brethren; hence the prohibition ‘against loving, and in any religious matter, using such titles, signifying dominion over the faith of others’ (Alford). A literal and particular application of the precept should be made with caution. Such applications may spring from the very pride here forbidden. So long as teachers are necessary in the Church, titles are necessary; but none which imply the right to lord it over the faith of others. Not the title, but the spirit which claims authority in teaching, is forbidden. In any case our addressing others by the usual title is not forbidden; pride taking the form of want of courtesy cannot find shelter here.
