Matthew 23:37-39. Luke (Luke 13:34-35) inserts this lamentation at an earlier point of the history. It was probably uttered twice, if but once, on this occasion, when it was peculiarly fitting. Comp. also Luke 19:41-44, where we find another lamentation over the city on His triumphant progress towards it.
