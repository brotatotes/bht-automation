<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:12">Matthew 24:12</span>. <strong> Because iniquity</strong> (or ‘lawlessness’) <strong> shall be multiplied</strong>. A horrible state of immorality prevailed in the first century, and the false teachers endeavored to join it with Christian profession <strong> ;</strong> the inevitable result was a coldness, a dying out of Christian love.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The love of the many</strong> (the mass) <strong> shall wax cold</strong>. So far as we know, this was not literally fulfilled in the first century. We infer that the entire fulfilment will come in with the great Apostasy (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3-8">2 Thessalonians 2:3-8</span>). The principle is: wickedness destroys love; immorality eats out the heart of Christianity.
