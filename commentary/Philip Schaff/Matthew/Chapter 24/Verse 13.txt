Matthew 24:13.  Unto the end. The Christians were saved from the horrors attending the destruction of Jerusalem. But the principle is a general one. For the individual, ‘the end’ is the day of his death  ; for the Church, it is the Advent of Christ, the end of all things. The last sense is the more important one, giving character to the others. Over against the apostasy of ‘the many’ (Matthew 24:12) we have the faithfulness of the few, in spite of false teaching (Matthew 24:11), in spite of prevailing wickedness (Matthew 24:12), an endurance in love.
