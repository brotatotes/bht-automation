On that day the gates of the cities were usually closed (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ne+13:19-22">Nehemiah 13:19-22</span>), besides travelling on that day would expose them still more to Jewish fanaticism. The Jewish Christians, up to the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, observed the Jewish Sabbath, and might scruple to travel more than the Sabbath day’s journey (about an English mile). Our Lord’s anxiety is not for the observance of the Jewish Sabbath, but for His people.
