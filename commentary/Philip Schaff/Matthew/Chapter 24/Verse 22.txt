<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:22">Matthew 24:22</span>. <strong> Except those days had been shortened</strong>, etc. (A prophetic past tense.) Various causes did combine to shorten the siege of Jerusalem, so that the Christians in the neighboring place of refuge were not so much exposed. These causes were <strong> :</strong> ( 1 ) Herod Agrippa had begun to fortify the walls of Jerusalem against any attack, but was stopped by orders from Claudius about 42 or 43 . ( 2 .) The Jews being divided into factions, had totally neglected any preparations against the siege. ( 3 .) The magazines of corn and provision were just burned before the arrival of Titus. ( 4 .) Titus arrived suddenly, and the Jews voluntarily abandoned parts of the fortification. ( 5 .) Titus himself confessed that he owed his victory to God, who took the fortifications of the Jews. ( 6 .) It was not the original intention to storm the place, but events at Rome made it necessary that Titus should hasten back, and he therefore adopted this method of shortening the siege. But the strong language of the verse and the prophecy of Daniel (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:1">Matthew 12:1</span>) which is here alluded to, point to a providentia interposition in the great days of tribulation which are to come ill <em> the last times.</em> The shortening of the days will be the hastening of the Lordâ€™s coming.
