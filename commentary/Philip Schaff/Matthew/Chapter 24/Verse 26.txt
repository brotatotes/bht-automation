Matthew 24:26.  Behold, he is in the wilderness, whither the impostors led their followers (Acts 21:38).
	 Behold, he is in the inner chambers,  teaching in private, proposing some scheme of deliverance. But Matthew 24:27 points so unmistakably to the last days also, that we understand this caution as referring to all teachers who assert that the kingdom of heaven is in a given locality, or in some narrow form, and who therefore set forth some contracted conception of the second Advent. The caution then is against enthusiasm, superstition, and fanaticism, in the days of the waiting Church.
