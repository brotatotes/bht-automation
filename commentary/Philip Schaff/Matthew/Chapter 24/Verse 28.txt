<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:28">Matthew 24:28</span>. <strong> Wheresoever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together.</strong> In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:37">Luke 17:37</span>, this figure is the answer to the question of the disciples <strong> :</strong> ‘Where Lord?’ referring to the times of judgment. We therefore apply the metaphor to the necessity, inevitableness, and universality (‘wheresoever’) of judgment. The ‘carcass’ represents moral corruption <strong> ;</strong> the ‘eagles,’ God’s means of certain punishment when the time is ripe. The context points to two special occasions: 1 . The destruction of Jerusalem when the Roman ‘eagles’ appeared as ministers of vengeance; 2 . the last days when the cup of the world’s iniquity shall be full and God’s swift messengers of judgment (‘the angels’) shall come. Yet the principle is of universal application, and has been again and again exemplified in God’s dealings. This verse answers the cry of the waiting Church: ‘How long, O Lord’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+6:10">Revelation 6:10</span>).

<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:29">Matthew 24:29</span> ff. Referring to the ‘last times’ exclusively. Up to this point our Lord, in answering a twofold question, has given a two-fold answer, <em> i.e.,</em> spoken of two distinct events as analogous. The instruction in regard to the minor and near event (the destruction of Jerusalem) was necessary, but now the greater and more remote event becomes the sole subject. (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:34">Matthew 24:34</span> presents a possible exception.)
