( 1 .) ‘Generation’ in the literal sense, the reference being to the destruction of Jerusalem. This is opposed by <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:36">Matthew 24:36</span>, nor is it allowable to accept a double sense in general, and confine this phrase to a single sense. ( 2 .) ‘Generation’ in the sense of ‘race,’ as often. <em> (a)</em> Applied to the Jewish nation, meaning that the Jewish people shall-remain until the fulfilment of all these things, and that one of the signs of the final fulfilment, will be a sudden greening of that withered race.

The single advantage of this is that it extends ‘ye,’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:33">Matthew 24:33</span>, to the whole body of believers <strong> ;</strong> but that would be easily so understood without this.
