Matthew 24:34.  This generation. Explanations. ( 1 .) ‘Generation’ in the literal sense, the reference being to the destruction of Jerusalem. This is opposed by Matthew 24:36, nor is it allowable to accept a double sense in general, and confine this phrase to a single sense. ( 2 .) ‘Generation’ in the sense of ‘race,’ as often.
