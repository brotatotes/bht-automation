Matthew 24:35.  Heaven and earth shall pass away  .  Not merely a strong asseveration (sooner shall heaven   and earth pass away), but also a plain declaration that they shall pass away. Comp. Psalms 102:26; Isaiah 51:6. The time is not indicated.
	 But my words shall not pass away. Scoffers imply: Heaven and earth cannot pass away (comp. 2 Peter 3:8-10), but Christ’s words are losing their force. ‘Of this we wait the proof.’ ‘Not pass away’ means more than ‘not remain unfulfilled;’ the words of Christ will abide as true in the hearts of all His people who look for and haste unto His coming. It is implied that some time will elapse.
