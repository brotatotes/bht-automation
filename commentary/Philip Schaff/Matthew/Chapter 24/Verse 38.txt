Matthew 24:38.  They were eating and drinking, seeking their enjoyment, not expecting the catastrophe. (As they were ‘drinking,’ it would seem that wine was made before the flood.) The verse does not at all imply that Christ’s people are to cease their ordinary employments, in expectation of the coming of Christ. Absorption in these things is censured.
