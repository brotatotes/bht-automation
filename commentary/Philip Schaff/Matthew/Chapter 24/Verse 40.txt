<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> One is taken</strong>, <em> i.e., </em> gathered as one of the elect (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:31">Matthew 24:31</span>). The one ‘taken’ is the blessed one. There is no direct allusion to death. This differs from the event referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:16-18">Matthew 24:16-18</span>, where voluntary flight is commanded, and from the judgment (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:31">Matthew 25:31</span> ff.) where all are gathered.
