Matthew 24:44.  Therefore be ye also ready. Comp. Luke 21:34; Luke 21:36. To be ready at all is to be ready always. The caution of this passage is not a threatening for the Lordâ€™s people. He does not rule them by terror; those ready find Him a Friend  ; only those not ready find His coming as uncomfortable as that of a thief.
