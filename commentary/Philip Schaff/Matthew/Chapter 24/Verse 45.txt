<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:45">Matthew 24:45</span>. <strong> Who then is</strong>! A personal question for every believer, but not a discouraging one.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The</strong> <strong> faithful and wise servant</strong>. ‘Wise’(or prudent), because ‘faithful’ in Christ’s service. Faithfulness alone is success.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Whom his Lord</strong> <strong> set over his household</strong>. Mark’s account (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:34">Matthew 13:34</span>) represents a number of servants left by the master, each with his appointed work. Here one servant is placed over the whole, as a steward. Ministers of Christ are referred to, since these are elsewhere represented as ‘set’ by Him in the Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:1-2">1 Corinthians 4:1-2</span>; 1Co 12:28 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:12">1 Thessalonians 5:12</span>, but for a specific purpose <strong> :</strong> <strong> to give them their meat</strong> (or ‘food’), namely, that provided by the Lord, and adapted and necessary for them, <strong> in</strong> <strong> due</strong> <strong> season</strong>. The food is God’s word, which is to be rightly divided (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:15">2 Timothy 2:15</span>). Ruling is included only as far as essential for the purposes of teaching. It is the ‘faithful servant’ whom the Lord has set over the household.
