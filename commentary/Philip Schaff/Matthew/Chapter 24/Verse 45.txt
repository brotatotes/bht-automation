Matthew 24:45.  Who then is! A personal question for every believer, but not a discouraging one.
	 The  faithful and wise servant. ‘Wise’(or prudent), because ‘faithful’ in Christ’s service. Faithfulness alone is success.
	 Whom his Lord  set over his household. Mark’s account (Matthew 13:34) represents a number of servants left by the master, each with his appointed work. Here one servant is placed over the whole, as a steward. Ministers of Christ are referred to, since these are elsewhere represented as ‘set’ by Him in the Church (1 Corinthians 4:1-2; 1Co 12:28 ; 1 Thessalonians 5:12, but for a specific purpose  :  to give them their meat (or ‘food’), namely, that provided by the Lord, and adapted and necessary for them,  in  due  season. The food is God’s word, which is to be rightly divided (2 Timothy 2:15). Ruling is included only as far as essential for the purposes of teaching. It is the ‘faithful servant’ whom the Lord has set over the household.
