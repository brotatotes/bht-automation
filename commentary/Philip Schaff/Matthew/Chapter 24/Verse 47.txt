Matthew 24:47.  He will set him over all his goods. The servant, faithful up to the unexpected arrival of his lord, is rewarded, and is called ‘blessed’ (Matthew 24:47). The reward is promotion to be possessor of the full inheritance. Comp. Romans 8:17; also chap. Matthew 25:21  ; Revelation 2:26; Revelation 3:21. Alford  : ‘  Each faithful servant shall be over  all  his master’s goods. That promotion shall not be like earthly promotion, wherein the eminence of one excludes that of another, but rather like the diffusion of love, in which, the more each has, the more there is for all.’
