Matthew 24:50.  The lord of that servant. Christ is still ‘lord’ of the unfaithful and sinful servant.
	 Shall  come. Doubt of His coming does not hinder it.
	 In a day, etc. The unexpected, sudden coming is again brought forward. To the unfaithful our Lord often comes suddenly in this world, to correct while hope of amendment remains, but Matthew 24:51 refers to something final. Before the Second Advent, when the whole Church shall be tried as to faithfulness, the coming to individuals is at death.
