Matthew 24:6.  Of    wars and rumours of wars. The primary reference is to the threats of war against the Jews before the campaign which ended in the destruction of Jerusalem. During this period there were unusual commotions among the Jews in all countries, and in Rome too. It is also a prediction of unexampled convulsions before the second coming of Christ. As wars have been well-nigh continuous, something greater than ordinary war is probably meant.
	 Be not troubled. Be watchful (Matthew 24:5), but be not disturbed. There will be nothing even in the last days to terrify the Lordâ€™s people.
	 The end is not yet,  i.e., this state of commotion is to continue.
