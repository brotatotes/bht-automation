Matthew 24:45-51. A parable, though not distinctly marked as such in its form. Comp. the parallel account in Mark 13:34-36; and similar language on another occasion in Luke 12:35-46. Such repetitions are not unusual. This passage, closely connected with the second Advent, contains instruction for the Church, while waiting for that event. It applies primarily to the Apostles (on the former occasion mentioned by Luke, it was called forth by Peter), and thus to all officers in the Church; but has an important lesson for all Christians. The contrast is between the faithful and the unfaithful servant, with a more extended reference to the latter.
