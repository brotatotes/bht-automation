The best explanation is: that the bridegroom was coming from a distance, before the wedding; that the virgins went out to meet him to attend him to the wedding at the house of the bride, where the marriage was to take place. Christ, the Bridegroom, comes from a distance, the bride is the Church  ; but she is not mentioned here, while the ‘virgins’ represent the individuals making up the Church, as do the guests in the parable of the wedding of the king’s son (chap. Matthew 22:1-14). Other views refer this to the procession, after the wedding, to the bridegroom’s house, where the closing festivities were held. This accords with Eastern customs, but is far less appropriate.
