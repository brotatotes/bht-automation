<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:12">Matthew 25:12</span>. <strong> I know you not. </strong> Comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:23">Matthew 7:23</span>. The refusal is definite and apparently final, and is the basis for the exhortation which follows. Some of the advocates of the pre-millenial view suppose that this refusal excludes only from the millenium, not from the ultimate kingdom of glory in heaven, finding a difference between the phrase here and in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:23">Matthew 7:23</span>. They refer the parable, not to the final judgment, but to the coming of the Lord to His personal reign. On this view the lesson respects the blessedness of endurance unto the end, of keeping the light bright for the coming of the Bridegroom, however delayed. The ten virgins represent Gentile congregations accompanying the Bride, the Jewish Church. Nor are any of them hypocrites, but all faithful souls bearing their lamps; the foolish ones, however, making no provision for the supply of the oil of the Spirit, but trusting that the light once burning, would ever burn, neglecting watchfulness and prayer. As it was, their lamps were only going out (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:8">Matthew 25:8</span>), and their effort was too late <em> for that time.</em> At the general judgment, such will be judged in common with the rest of the dead. To all this it may be objected that the final judgment has already been spoken of in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:51">Matthew 24:51</span>, and that the exhortation of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:13">Matthew 25:13</span> loses its emphasis, if there is another day of grace for these.
