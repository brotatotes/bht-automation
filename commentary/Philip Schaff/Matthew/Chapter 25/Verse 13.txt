Matthew 25:13.  Watch therefore. The same admonition as in chap. Matthew 24:42; Matthew 24:44. ‘Wherein the Son of man cometh’ is omitted by the best authorities. This makes the exhortation more general. The coming of our Lord, in so far as individuals are concerned, is the day of death. Then the door, is shut: the door of repentance, of hope, of salvation, shut by Him that shutteth and none can open, ‘watch therefore,’ that the Christian profession is supplied by the oil of the Spirit, so that His sudden unexpected coming may not find us without oil for our lamps.
