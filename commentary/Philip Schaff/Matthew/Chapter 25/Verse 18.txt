<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:18">Matthew 25:18</span>. <strong> Went away,</strong> in carelessness.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Digged</strong> <strong> in the earth and hid his lord’s money.</strong> Not an active ill-doer, like the wicked servant of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:48">Matthew 24:48</span>, but simply neglectful of the blessing given him. He buried his spiritual gift in what is earthly, fleshly; ‘the napkin’ in the other parable means idleness in office. The man with the one (spiritual) talent is negligent, not because he has little natural capacity, but from envy, or false ideas of human inability (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:24">Matthew 25:24</span>), etc. The one talent may represent the general influences of the Spirit of God. In our history as Christians, this one may be changed to five.
