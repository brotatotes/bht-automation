Matthew 25:18.  Went away, in carelessness.
	 Digged  in the earth and hid his lord’s money. Not an active ill-doer, like the wicked servant of Matthew 24:48, but simply neglectful of the blessing given him. He buried his spiritual gift in what is earthly, fleshly; ‘the napkin’ in the other parable means idleness in office. The man with the one (spiritual) talent is negligent, not because he has little natural capacity, but from envy, or false ideas of human inability (Matthew 25:24), etc. The one talent may represent the general influences of the Spirit of God. In our history as Christians, this one may be changed to five.
