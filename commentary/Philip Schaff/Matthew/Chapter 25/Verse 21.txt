Matthew 25:21.  I will set thee over many things. In the kingdom of glory; or on the other theory, during the millenium.
	 Into the joy of thy Lord. In Luke the official position is recognized in the rule over ‘ten cities,’ etc.; here the reward has a reference to the personal spiritual life. ‘The joy;’ the blessed inheritance which Christ’s servants will have with Him. The reference to a ‘feast’ seems unnecessary.
