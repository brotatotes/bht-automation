<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:24">Matthew 25:24</span>. <strong> Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man.</strong> A common excuse: the master is hard and selfish. Men represent God as demanding from them what they cannot perform. In the parable, and in reality, the excuse is inconsistent and self-convicting.

<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> Reaping where thou didst not sow.</strong> ‘ <em> This is man’s lie,</em> to encourage himself in idleness’ (Alford). Didst not scatter. A repetition of the former thought, the sowing being represented as a scattering to bring into contrast the gathering into the bam. A reference to ‘winnowing’ is less satisfactory.
