Matthew 25:25.  I was afraid. Both true and false. He had a fear of his lord’s punishment, but that did not make him idle. Being afraid of God, is an excuse not a reason, for men’s misimprovement of His gifts. The insolent speech shows that the servant did not really regard his master as ‘hard.’
	 Thou hast thine own. The interest of the money, the profit of his own time and labor, due to the lord, should have been added, before this could be true. Such a closing of accounts with God, is an eternal breach with Him.
