Comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:12">Matthew 13:12</span>, where it is applied to spiritual knowledge (through parables); here it refers to the whole spiritual life. It is not a law for conduct between man and man, but of God’s dealings in providence and grace. He is the owner, and we the trustees, obligated to serve Him moreover.
