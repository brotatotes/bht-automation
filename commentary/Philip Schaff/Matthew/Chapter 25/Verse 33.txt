Matthew 25:33.  The sheep on his right hand,  the place of preference. The pre-millenial view refers ‘the sheep’ to the unconscious Christians among the heathen, hinted at in Romans 2:7; Romans 2:10, including the ‘other sheep,’ ‘not of this fold.’ But how unlikely that, in this great picture, believers should be excluded, when the term ‘sheep’ is appropriated to them so often.
