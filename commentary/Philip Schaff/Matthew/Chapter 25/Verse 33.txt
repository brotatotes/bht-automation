The pre-millenial view refers ‘the sheep’ to the unconscious Christians among the heathen, hinted at in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:7">Romans 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:10">Romans 2:10</span>, including the ‘other sheep,’ ‘not of this fold.’ But how unlikely that, in this great picture, believers should be excluded, when the term ‘sheep’ is appropriated to them so often.
