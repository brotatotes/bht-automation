<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:34">Matthew 25:34</span>. <strong> The King.</strong> Christ Himself. From this point there is no figure. It is the only time that our Lord thus calls Himself, though He acknowledges the title before Pilate (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:11">Matthew 27:11</span>). He is the judge; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:38">Luke 19:38</span>, and many other passages.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Ye blessed of my Father.</strong> Not ‘blessed’ now for the first time; whether believers or unconscious Christians, all the good in them came from the Father, through the Spirit, and for the sake of the Son. God has but one way of blessing.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Inherit the kingdom.</strong> Peculiarly appropriate to the ‘elect,’ even were they gathered together before this time. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:14-17">Romans 8:14-17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:6-7">Galatians 4:6-7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:14">Hebrews 1:14</span>.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</strong> Christ has gone to prepare a place for His people (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:2">John 14:2</span>); but it was prepared for them from ‘the foundation of the world’ (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24">John 17:24</span>). The idea of choosing unto eternal life is plainly implied here, as it is expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:37">John 6:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29-30">Romans 8:29-30</span>; Eph 1:11 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span>. What follows shows human responsibility in the case of all. ‘For you;’ the salvation of men was an eternal purpose.
