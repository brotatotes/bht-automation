Matthew 25:40.  Unto one of these least  (or, these the least’)  of my brethren, ye did it unto me. This principle is the basis of Christian charity, as of all Christian morality. The prominence given to it shows that real faith in Christ must manifest itself in such Christian charity. The early Christians acted at once on this principle. Christ lives again and perpetually in the persons of His people; as we treat them, we treat Him. All men are to be treated thus, because possible brethren of Christ. Some suppose that the saints appear with Christ as judges; hence the expression, ‘these my brethren.’ But no theory need exclude the pleasing thought that some may have unconsciously been ‘blessed by the Father,’ with love in their hearts, feeling its way to Him who is Love, through acts of charity to men, even while Christ has not been made known to them.
