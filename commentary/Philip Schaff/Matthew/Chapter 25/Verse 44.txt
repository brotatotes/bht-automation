Matthew 25:44.  When saw we thee, etc. A self  - righteous plea of ignorance, implying that they would have done such good works, had they seen Him. The answer of the Lord in Matthew 25:45, repeats the principle of Matthew 25:40. Many fancy they would do good to Christ, who fail to see Him in the person of His followers; and the deceitful fancy often continues until the day of retribution.
