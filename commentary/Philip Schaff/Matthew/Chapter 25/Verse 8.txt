Matthew 25:8.  For our lamps are going out, not ‘have gone out’ The trimming of the wick made this apparent. Merely outward Christian appearance will show its insufficiency in the midnight when the Bridegroom comes, yet even then be only ‘going out.’ This natural request represents what will occur in various forms in the hour here prefigured.
