The close connection of this parable with the last is indicated by its opening words. The time is the same, but the two can readily be distinguished: ‘The virgins were represented as  waiting for the Lord, we have here the servants  working for Him. There the inward spiritual rest of the Christian was described; here his external activity. There, by the end of the foolish virgins, we are warned against declensions and delays, in the inward spiritual life; here against sluggishness and sloth in our outward vocation and work ‘(Trench).’ There, the foolish virgins failed  from thinking their part too easy here the wicked servant fails  from thinking his too hard ’ (Alford). This parable must also be distinguished from that of the ten pounds (  mina); Luke 19:2-27. They were uttered on different occasions (this on the Mount of Olives just before the crucifixion, that in Jericho the week previous); with a different purpose; that to warn against the idea of the  speedy coming of the kingdom of God in a temporal sense, this to exhort disciples to be ready for the return of the Lord. The trust in the one case is the same for each servant, here according to ability; there is a difference in the number of servants, and in the purpose of the Lord’s absence; the behavior of the wicked servant is not described in identical terms: the parable in Luke applies to official persons; this to all, even nominal, Christians.
