<p>The order is chronological (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:24">Mark 7:24</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:10">Mark 8:10</span>; especially the miracle peculiar to that Gospel). This visit of our Lord to Gentile regions followed an attack from the <em> </em> Pharisees. (Comp, the course of Paul; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:46">Acts 13:46</span>.) The interview with the heathen woman is striking and prophetic. The Jews reject the blessing; the Gentiles seek it with longing desire. The heathen world had been prepared for Him who was ‘a light to lighten the Gentiles.’ The incident was timely <em> . </em> It prepared the Apostles for their universal mission, and also for the prophecy (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:21">Matthew 16:21</span>) of His death at Jerusalem. They must see the faith of the Gentiles, before they could learn the faithlessness of the Jews. <em> </em> On the second miracle of feeding the multitudes, comp, the account of the first (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:15-21">Matthew 14:15-21</span>). Four Evangelists tell of the first; <em> </em> two of the second. The six accounts emphasize one thought: Christ the Bread of Life, sufficient for all.
