The order is chronological (comp. Mark 7:24 to Mark 8:10; especially the miracle peculiar to that Gospel). This visit of our Lord to Gentile regions followed an attack from the   Pharisees. (Comp, the course of Paul; Acts 13:46.) The interview with the heathen woman is striking and prophetic. The Jews reject the blessing; the Gentiles seek it with longing desire. The heathen world had been prepared for Him who was ‘a light to lighten the Gentiles.’ The incident was timely  .  It prepared the Apostles for their universal mission, and also for the prophecy (chap. Matthew 16:21) of His death at Jerusalem. They must see the faith of the Gentiles, before they could learn the faithlessness of the Jews.   On the second miracle of feeding the multitudes, comp, the account of the first (chap. Matthew 14:15-21). Four Evangelists tell of the first;   two of the second. The six accounts emphasize one thought: Christ the Bread of Life, sufficient for all.
