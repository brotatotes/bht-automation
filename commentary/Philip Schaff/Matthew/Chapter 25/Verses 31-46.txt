<p>We have here a picture of the final judgment, ‘the end of the world;’ not a parable, though containing the figure of a shepherd dividing the sheep from the goats (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:32-33">Matthew 25:32-33</span>). The pre-millenial theory places this after the millenium, referring it only to those who were not Christians; ‘all the gentiles’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:32">Matthew 25:32</span>). In favor of this are urged, the previous statements about the gathering out of the elect (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:31">Matthew 24:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:40-41">Matthew 24:40-41</span>), the declarations of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16-17">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:7-10">2 Thessalonians 1:7-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:2-15">Revelation 20:2-15</span>, the answer of the ‘blessed’ in this section (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:37-39">Matthew 25:37-39</span>), which is considered incompatible with a knowledge of Christianity. The whole judgment being according to ‘works,’ without reference to faith. But this involves many difficulties and inconsistencies, <em> e. g.,</em> that those represented by the foolish virgins reappear in the judgment; that during this personal reign of Christ, the world still remains in ignorance of the simplest gospel truth (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:37-39">Matthew 25:37-39</span>). There are difficulties on the other side: <em> e. g.,</em> how the saints who are to judge the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:2">1 Corinthians 6:2</span>) are themselves brought to this final judgment; how the millenium, which is to be a time of holiness and peace, can immediately precede the coming of Christ, which is to follow ‘tribulation’ (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:29-30">Matthew 24:29-30</span>). It is safest to hold, that an interval of some kind, the character of which is not fully known, will occur between the advent of Christ and the final judgment. That Christians are not included in the latter, is not warranted by the section before us. Many of the materialistic and exclusive notions which have been appended to the pre-millenial view are objectionable and hurtful. The <em> time</em> when the discourse was uttered should not be lost sight of, in these discussions as to when it will be fulfilled. Jerome says: ‘He who was within two days to celebrate the passover and to be crucified, fitly now sets forth the glory of His triumph.’ This contrast deepens our view of the divine foresight and majesty of our Lord, and the sublimity of this description.
