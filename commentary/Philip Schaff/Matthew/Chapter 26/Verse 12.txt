<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:12">Matthew 26:12</span>. <strong> To prepare me for burial. </strong> Mary may have been aware of the predicted crucifixion, and thought of His actual burial when she anointed Him. If she was conscious of the meaning of her own act, then her love discerned what the disciples could not perceive; if she was not, then the Lord gives to acts of love a significance beyond the intention. The latter view seems the more probable one, if the earlier date be accepted. The expressions in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:8">Mark 14:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:7">John 12:7</span>, imply that she had a presentiment of an impending crisis, after which anointing would be unnecessary or impossible.
