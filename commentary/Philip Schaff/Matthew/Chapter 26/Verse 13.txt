Matthew 26:13.  Verily, etc. A solemn, weighty preface.
	 This gospel. The tidings of salvation, with special reference to Christâ€™s death, just alluded to.
	 In the whole world. A prediction of the world-wide preaching of His death.
	 That also which this woman did shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. Fulfilled to the letter. John, before he tells of this, speaks of Mary as well known on this account (John 11:2). It is right to record and remember the good deeds of those who love Christ, but when the desire to be put on record enters, the ointment is spoiled. This is the only case where such a promise is made; therefore the incident has a weighty lesson and holds up a noble example. Alford suggests, that this prophecy points to a  written record: that it shows the Gospels cannot have been made up from some original document now lost; since Luke omits this incident, and such a document would have contained it; Luke could not have seen the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, or he would have inserted this to aid in fulfilling the prophecy.
