Matthew 26:17.  On the first day of unleavened bread.  The 14 th of Nisan, when the leaven was removed. In the evening of this day (after the 15 th had begun) the Passover was eaten. (See note on p. 207 ).
	 The disciples.  It is probable that they came with the intention of inquiring on this point, and their thought was answered by the command mentioned in Luke (Luke 22:8), to which they responded:  Where wilt thou, etc. As strangers they must join some household in the city. The householder kept the lamb from the 10 th day of the month; he presented it in the temple, ‘between the evenings,’  i.e., between three and six o’clock in the afternoon of the fourteenth, himself slew it. The priests, standing in a row extending to the altar, received the blood in silver basins, which they passed from hand to hand, until at the foot of the altar the blood was poured out, whence it flowed by an underground conduit into the brook Kedron. This took the place of the sprinkling of the blood on the doorposts. The householder then removed the skin and fat from the lamb; the latter was burned on the altar by the priest, the former was carried home bound about the lamb. As the number of lambs was very great the persons bringing them were admitted in detachments. The disciples asked where they should find a householder who was ready to do this, and whom they, as his guests, would assist. The accounts of Mark and Luke intimate that most of the preparations were already made.
