<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> To such a man. </strong> The name is not given. Mark and Luke give the sign by which they should find the right person: a man should meet them, bearing a pitcher of water, and following him, they should address the master of the house he entered. Possibly the householder was a believer; of a previous understanding there is no hint. Such hospitality was usual on such occasions. This mode of directing the disciples would prevent Judas from knowing the place in time to betray our Lord at the Passover meal.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The Master saith.</strong> The man must have recognized to some extent our Lord’s authority.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> My time is at hand. </strong> The time of suffering; not the time of my Passover, over against the ordinary time of observing it. How far either the disciples or the householder understood this is uncertain.
