Matthew 26:18.  Go into the city. Addressed to ‘two of his disciples’ (Mark), ‘Peter and John’ (Luke).

Mark and Luke give the sign by which they should find the right person: a man should meet them, bearing a pitcher of water, and following him, they should address the master of the house he entered. Possibly the householder was a believer; of a previous understanding there is no hint. Such hospitality was usual on such occasions. This mode of directing the disciples would prevent Judas from knowing the place in time to betray our Lord at the Passover meal.
