Matthew 26:2.  After two days. This means, ‘the day after tomorrow,’ according to Jewish usage. As Wednesday had begun, Friday is the day indicated, beginning at sundown on (our) Thursday.
	 The passover cometh.  On the origin of this feast, see Exodus 12:0. The word ‘passover’ expresses the literal sense of the Hebrew word, which refers to the passing over of the destroying angel, sparing the first-born of Israel in Egypt. It was the greatest Jewish festival; a sacrificial feast (the paschal lamb with its blood sprinkled on the door-posts) and a memorial feast of thanksgiving. The lamb was not consumed on the altar, nor made the portion of the priests, but used as food by the household of the offerer. Other ideas were expressed in the observances connected with it, most of which were typical of ‘Christ our Passover.’ The word ‘passover’ is used in a threefold sense in the New Testament: ( 1 .) The paschal lamb itself; Mark 14:12; Luke 22:7. ( 2 .) The sacrificial lamb  and the supper, Matthew 26:17; Mark 14:14; Luke 22:11. ( 3 .) The  whole feast of unleavened bread, which lasted seven days, which is the sense here, and in Luke 22:1; comp. John 2:13; John 6:4; John 11:15; John 12:1; John 13:1, etc.
	 Delivered up to be crucified. The prophecy here is of the time. The events had already been foretold. That time was appointed, because our Lord would thus fulfil all that was typified in the Passover.
