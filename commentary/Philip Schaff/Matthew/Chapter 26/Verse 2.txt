<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> The passover cometh. </strong> On the origin of this feast, see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:0">Exodus 12:0</span>. The word ‘passover’ expresses the literal sense of the Hebrew word, which refers to the passing over of the destroying angel, sparing the first-born of Israel in Egypt. It was the greatest Jewish festival; a sacrificial feast (the paschal lamb with its blood sprinkled on the door-posts) and a memorial feast of thanksgiving. The lamb was not consumed on the altar, nor made the portion of the priests, but used as food by the household of the offerer. Other ideas were expressed in the observances connected with it, most of which were typical of ‘Christ our Passover.’ The word ‘passover’ is used in a threefold sense in the New Testament: ( 1 .) The paschal lamb itself; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:12">Mark 14:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:7">Luke 22:7</span>. ( 2 .) The sacrificial lamb <em> and the</em> supper, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:17">Matthew 26:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:14">Mark 14:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:11">Luke 22:11</span>. ( 3 .) The <em> whole feast</em> of unleavened bread, which lasted seven days, which is the sense here, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:1">Luke 22:1</span>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:13">John 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:4">John 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:15">John 11:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1">John 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span>, etc.
