<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:21">Matthew 26:21</span>. <strong> And as they were eating.</strong> The four Evangelists are entirely independent in their accounts of the Last Supper. Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:15-18">Luke 17:15-18</span>) records the expression of our Lord’s desire to eat the Passover with them <em> ;</em> and this seems to have been the first incident, attending the first cup (the announcement of the feast). The washing of the disciples ‘feet is mentioned by John only (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:4-12">Matthew 13:4-12</span>), and this preceded the announcement of the betrayer (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:21-30">John 13:21-30</span>) which our verse narrates. The strife as to who should be greatest, mentioned by Luke only (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:21-30">Matthew 22:21-30</span>), seems to have been the immediate occasion of the washing of the disciples’ feet; hence the probable order was: ( 1 ) the expression of desire; ( 2 )this strife; ( 3 ) the washing of the disciples’ feet; ( 4 ) the announcement that one should betray Him, mentioned by all four Evangelists.
