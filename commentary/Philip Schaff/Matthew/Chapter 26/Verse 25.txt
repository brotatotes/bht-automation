Matthew 26:25.  And Judas.  John, who was next to our Lord (John 13:23), gives a more detailed account of what he saw and heard; which probably took place before the question of Judas, after the giving of the sop. The hypocrisy of that question at such a time is an indication that, ‘after the sop Satan entered into him’ (John 13:27).
	 Thou hast said it. An affirmative answer (see Matthew 26:64; comp. Mark 14:62), uttered in close connection with the words: ‘What thou doest, do quickly’ (John 13:27). The misunderstanding of these words and the immediate withdrawal of Judas, prevented the disciples from seeing, even now, the purpose of Judas.
	 Judas not present. Matthew and Mark place the institution after the announcement respecting the betrayal. Luke hints at the latter after the account of the former, but his order is obviously less exact. John shows that Judas went out after the announcement, but does not mention the institution at all. It is therefore most probable that Judas went out (John 13:30)  before the institution. As however ‘dipping into the dish’ (Matthew 26:23), indicates that the supper was in progress, which usually began with the breaking of the unleavened bread, it is possible that Judas was present at the distribution of the bread, but not at the giving of the cup. (In that case, the laity in the Romish Church have only Judas’ portion.) The breaking of bread may have been deferred in this case, or, as is more likely still, was an act altogether distinct from the usual distribution of the Passover cakes. The account of Luke favors the latter view. Practical exhortations based on the presence of Judas at the Lord’s Supper are of very doubtful propriety.
