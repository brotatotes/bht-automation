Matthew 26:30.  And when they had sung a hymn  (Psalms 115-118.)  , they went out unto the mount of Olives,  to Gethsemane (Matthew 26:36). Between the hymn and the going out we must insert the discourse and prayer of John 14-17. The place of eating the Passover was probably kept concealed, to give time for that closing interview, appropriately called, ‘the Holy of Holies.’
