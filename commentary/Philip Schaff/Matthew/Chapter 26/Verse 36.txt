<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:36">Matthew 26:36</span>. <strong> Unto a place called Gethsemane.</strong> Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:39">Luke 22:39</span>) says in general ‘to the mount of Olives,’ though hinting at a customary place; John (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1-2">John 17:1-2</span>) tells us that was a ‘garden’ beyond the brook Kedron, known to Judas, ‘for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with His disciples. ‘‘Place ‘means ‘a piece of land,’ ‘field’ (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:5">John 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:18">Acts 1:18</span>, etc.); ‘Gethsemane’ <em> </em> means ‘oil-press.’ It was probably an enclosed olive-yard, containing a press and garden tower, perhaps a dwelling-house. It was at the western foot of the Mount of Olives beyond the Kedron (‘black brook’), so called from its dark waters, which were still more darkened by the blood from the foot of the altar in the temple (see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:17">Matthew 26:17</span>). The spot now pointed out as Gethsemane lies on the right of the path to the Mount of Olives. The wall has been restored. Eight olive trees remain, all of them very old (each one has paid a special tax since A. D. 636 ), but scarcely of the time of our Lord, since Titus, during the siege of Jerusalem, had all the trees of the district cut down. Dr. Thomson <em> (The Land and the Book)</em> thinks the garden was in a more secluded place further on, to the left of the path. The name has been connected with the bruising of our Lord for our sins.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Sit ye here,</strong> i.e. <em> , </em> ‘stay here.’ These eight would form, as it were, a watch against premature surprise.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> And pray.</strong> Our Lord speaks of the coming struggle as prayer. So Abraham (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:5">Genesis 22:5</span>), when he, almost on the same spot, was going to the greatest trial of his faith.
