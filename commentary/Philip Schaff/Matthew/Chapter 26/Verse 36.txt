Matthew 26:36.  Unto a place called Gethsemane. Luke (Luke 22:39) says in general ‘to the mount of Olives,’ though hinting at a customary place; John (John 17:1-2) tells us that was a ‘garden’ beyond the brook Kedron, known to Judas, ‘for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with His disciples. ‘‘Place ‘means ‘a piece of land,’ ‘field’ (see John 4:5; Acts 1:18, etc.); ‘Gethsemane’   means ‘oil-press.’ It was probably an enclosed olive-yard, containing a press and garden tower, perhaps a dwelling-house.
