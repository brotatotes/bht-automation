<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:42">Matthew 26:42</span>. <strong> Again a second time.</strong> Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:39">Mark 14:39</span>): ‘spake the same words.’ The prayer is substantially the same, but the form indicates more fully the resignation and self-sacrifice: the cup had not passed away, He must drink it, and He says: <strong> Thy will be done.
