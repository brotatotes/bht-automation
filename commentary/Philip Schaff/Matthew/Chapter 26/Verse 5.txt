Matthew 26:5.  Not during the feast,  i.e., the Passover week, during which the multitudes (sometimes reckoned at three millions on such occasions) remained at Jerusalem. Most of Christâ€™s followers were Galileans, and the Galileans were all considered bold and quarrelsome. This feast was often the occasion of insurrection, according to Josephus. They could not take Him when they would (John 10:39), yet must take Him at a time when they purposed not, but which He had predicted (Matthew 26:2). Both the taking and killing took place between the evenings of Thursday and Friday, which made up the first Passover day. Even in the greatest humiliation His power and truth still shine forth.
