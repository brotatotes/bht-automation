<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:51">Matthew 26:51</span>. <strong> One of them.</strong> Peter, as was well known (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:26">John 18:26</span>), but only John gives the name.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Drew his sword.</strong> According to Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:49">Luke 22:49</span>) the question was first asked: ‘Shall we smite with the sword? ‘Peter did not wait for the answer. They had two swords (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:38">Luke 22:38</span>), whoever had the other one was not so rash.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The servant of the high-priest. </strong> Named ‘Malchus; ‘ <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:10">John 18:10</span>.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> His ear. </strong> The ‘right ear’(Luke and John). Peter was no swordsman, for he missed his blow. In any case carnal weapons used in Christ’s cause deprive His opponents of ‘ears,’ <em> i.e.,</em> of willingness to listen to the truth. Christ’s grace may restore this willingness, as it healed this ear. The healing is mentioned by Luke (the physician) only. The double effect of Peter’s rashness, damage to Malchus and danger to himself, were thus removed.
