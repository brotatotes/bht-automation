Matthew 26:52.  Thy sword; not mine!
	 Into its place,   i.e., the sheath (John 18:11). Peter was still standing with drawn sword.
	 For all they that take the sword.  A general proposition in regard to unwarranted recourse to measures of violence.
	 Shall perish with the sword.  The special reference is to Peter. In taking the sword he had been imprudent, and exposed himself to a superior force; had been revolutionary, for these came with authority; had been cruel, for the mutilation of a human being in a spiritual cause is uncalled for. His life would have been forfeited to the sword, had not our Lord interfered and removed the effects of his blow. Any special application to the armed band who came to take Him seems unlikely. But as a rule, the violent perish violently. The circumstances of this occasion (Peter trying to kill, and the band representing authority, even though abused), as well as a comparison with Genesis 9:6; Romans 13:4, warrant an application to the justice of capital punishment for murder. The great lesson is: The Church, a spiritual body, may use spiritual weapons only (comp. 2 Corinthians 10:3-4); never carnal and violent measures.
