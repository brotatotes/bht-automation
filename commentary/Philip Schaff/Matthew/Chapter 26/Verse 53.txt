Matthew 26:53.  Or thinkest thou. An appeal to Peter’s faith, and also a declaration of power and an exhibition of patience.

A legion included more than six thousand men. ‘Twelve;’ probably in allusion to the twelve persons (Himself and the eleven) opposed to this midnight band; a legion for each; a mighty host, all-sufficient to help them. Peter is rebuked, not for distrust of God’s power, but for using force. Were that necessary, it would have come in answer to prayer. Christ, in mercy to men, chose to gain His victory by suffering and long-suffering. When force is needed, Christ will appear with the angels (chap. Matthew 25:31). Before that time, every use of it tends only to evil. Violence against the conscience, as well as against the b  ody, reacts upon those employing it.
