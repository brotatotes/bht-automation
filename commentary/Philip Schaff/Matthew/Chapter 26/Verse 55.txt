Matthew 26:55.  Multitudes. Especially the rulers and temple-guards (Luke 22:52). Mark (Mark 14:48) says ‘answers,’  i.e., to their actions, not their words. He was probably bound, at this time, but His protest does not imply a desire to resist.
	 As against a robber, not ‘a thief,’ against whom no such display of force would be needed.
	 Sat. Unmolested and unlike a robber.
	 Daily.  From day to day, as during the past week.
	 In the temple,  the most public place in Jerusalem.
	 Teaching. Not unobserved, so that you needed to seek me; nor yet riotous or robbing, as your present conduct implies.
	 And ye took me not.  They dared not (chap. Matthew 21:46); the method now adopted showed the malignity of an evil conscience, and also a deceitful purpose to turn the current against Him.
