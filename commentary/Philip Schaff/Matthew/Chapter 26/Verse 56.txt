<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:56">Matthew 26:56</span>. <strong> But all this hath come to pass.</strong> The words of our Lord. Mark gives a briefer form of the same thought; Luke, another expression, supplementing this: ‘but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.’ This word of our Lord is therefore His final surrender of Himself to death; a willing offering of Himself for others, in accordance with the purpose of a merciful God.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Then all the disciples forsook him.</strong> All who had joined with Peter in his protestation (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:35">Matthew 26:35</span>). This forsaking is connected with the last word of our Lord. He says He submits, their courage fails them. Only after Christ died for men, could men die for Him.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> And fled.</strong> Not absolutely. See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:51">Mark 14:51</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:54">Luke 22:54</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:15">John 18:15</span>. When the eleven forsook the Lord, other disciples, as Nicodemus, and Joseph of Arimathea, took a more decided stand for Him. The Church can never fail; new Christians take the place of the old ones.
