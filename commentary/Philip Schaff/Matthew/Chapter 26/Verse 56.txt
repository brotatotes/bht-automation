Matthew 26:56.  But all this hath come to pass. The words of our Lord. Mark gives a briefer form of the same thought; Luke, another expression, supplementing this: ‘but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.’ This word of our Lord is therefore His final surrender of Himself to death; a willing offering of Himself for others, in accordance with the purpose of a merciful God.
	 Then all the disciples forsook him. All who had joined with Peter in his protestation (Matthew 26:35). This forsaking is connected with the last word of our Lord. He says He submits, their courage fails them. Only after Christ died for men, could men die for Him.
	 And fled. Not absolutely. See Mark 14:51; Luke 22:54; John 18:15. When the eleven forsook the Lord, other disciples, as Nicodemus, and Joseph of Arimathea, took a more decided stand for Him. The Church can never fail; new Christians take the place of the old ones.
