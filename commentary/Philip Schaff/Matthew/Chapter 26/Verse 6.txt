<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> In the house of Simon the leper. </strong> Probably already healed by Jesus, since otherwise he would have been unclean. He must not be confounded with the Pharisee called Simon, at whose house in Galilee a similar anointing had taken place long before (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:36-50">Luke 7:36-50</span>). The two occurrences are clearly distinguished in many ways. One tradition makes this Simon the father of Lazarus; another the husband of Martha, who served on this occasion. Both families may have occupied the same house; or Simon may have been the owner, and Lazarus his tenant.
