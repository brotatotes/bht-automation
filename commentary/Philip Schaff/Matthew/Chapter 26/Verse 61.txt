<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Said;</strong> see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:19">John 2:19</span>, for what our Lord really said.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> I am able to destroy the temple, </strong> etc. The testimony as recorded by Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:58">Mark 14:58</span>) differs in form, but the same Evangelist says (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:59">Matthew 26:59</span>) their witness did not agree. Differing in minor circumstances, they probably agreed in making the saying one derogatory to the temple. Such were regarded as blasphemous by the Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:13">Acts 6:13</span>); the temple being the symbol of their religion. The witnesses were probably guilty of wilful misinterpretation. The Sanhedrin knew what the true sense of the words was (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:63">Matthew 27:63</span>), and the witnesses were probably fully aware of it. Our Lord’s zeal in cleansing the temple (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:12-13">Matthew 21:12-13</span>) should have been an evidence to all that He would not speak slightingly of it. Besides, if they supposed He meant the temple in Jerusalem, they heard His promise of restoring it, which could not imply hostility to the temple itself. The words of our Lord are a prophecy of His death, and yet of His ultimate victory; this, in their blindness and fanaticism they could make a ground for condemnation.
