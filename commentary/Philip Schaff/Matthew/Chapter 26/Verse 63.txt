Matthew 26:63.  But Jesus held his peace. Before Annas He had spoken (John 18:19-23), but that was not an official hearing. Here under false witness and reproach He (as before Herod) is silent, in patience and confidence of victory. The testimony was false in fact, even if partially true in form. An answer would have involved an explanation, which his opposers either knew already or were too hostile to accept. The silence does not, as early interpreters thought, point to our silence before the judgment seat of God, had He not taken our place and been silent before His judges; for His silence led to their greater judgment and self-condemnation.

Of all the testimonies in favor of the divinity of Christ, this is the most clear and definite’ (Gerlach).
