<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:64">Matthew 26:64</span>. <strong> Jesus saith.</strong> Put upon judicial oath our Lord replies. To be silent would be construed as a confession that He was not the Messiah.
	</p>
<p><strong> Thou hast said. </strong> An affirmative answer (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:62">Mark 14:62</span>: ‘I am’). This calm response, drawn out by the oath, is a public declaration of His Messiahship. It ensured His death, but laid full responsibility upon them. The Faithful Witness (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+1:0">Revelation 1:0</span>) did not falter or fail.
	</p>
<p><strong> Moreover, </strong> not ‘nevertheless.’ Over and above the confession, which they would not believe, His glory would appear to them as a sign of its truth. He was conscious of His glory in the moment of His condemnation, in His deepest humiliation. This declaration would be a warning to any not hardened in their opposition, but to most, if not all, it was a prophecy of judgment. From henceforth shall ye see. Not simply at some time ‘hereafter,’ but in all the future. Christ’s glorification began as soon as their proceedings against him were finished, and in such a way as to make the Jewish people see His power. The prophecy has been fulfilled ever since.

<p><strong> Sitting as they now sat to judge Him, </strong> with a reference to the quiet confidence of His future position in glory.
	</p>
<p><strong> At the right hand, </strong> <em> i.e.,</em> the place of honor.
	</p>
<p><strong> Of power,</strong> <em> i.e.,</em> of God, who is Almighty. This expression is used in contrast with His present weakness. The whole alludes to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:1">Psalms 110:1</span>, which He had quoted to them in the last encounter (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:44">Matthew 22:44</span>).
	</p>
<p><strong> And coming on the clouds of heaven.</strong> ‘The sign from heaven’ they had demanded (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:11">Mark 8:11</span>). This refers to Christ’s final appearing, but may include His coming to judgment on the Jewish people, at the destruction of Jerusalem.
