Matthew 26:65.  Then the high-priest rent his clothes,  his upper-garment, not the high-priestly robe, which was worn only in the temple. Rending the clothes was a sign of mourning or of indignation (Acts 14:14), but in the former sense was forbidden to the high-priest (Leviticus 10:6; Leviticus 21:10). Instances of the high-priests using this sign of indignation occur in the first Book of the Maccabees and Josephus.
