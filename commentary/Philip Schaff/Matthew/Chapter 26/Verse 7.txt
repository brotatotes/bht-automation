Matthew 26:7.  There came unto him a woman. Mary, the sister of Lazarus (comp. Matthew 10:38-42; John 11:0); not the woman (in Luke 7:0), ‘who was a sinner.’ The latter person is generally, but without reason, identified with Mary Magdalene, and the three women confounded.
	 Having an alabaster box, or ‘vase.’ Alabaster cruses were considered by the ancients the best receptacle for valuable ointments or fragrant oils. The vessels usually had a long neck and were sealed at the top.
	 Of very precious ointment. ‘A pound of ointment of spikenard,’ according to John; ‘ointment of spikenard, very precious,’ according to Mark (Mark 14:3, see notes on that passage). It is supposed to have been a rare gum, from India, liquid when taken from the tree. The main point is its preciousness. Comp, the valuation put upon it by Judas (‘three hundred pence ‘= £ 9 or $ 45 , a large amount for those days.)
	 Poured it over his head.  By breaking the neck of the flask, probably by compressing it in her hands. The quantity of ointment permitted her to anoint his feet also (John 12:3). The Oriental custom of reclining at table made the latter easier than the former. The expression used by Mark (Mark 14:3), hints that from the head it flowed over the whole body. It was also usual to wash the feet of honored guests with water, but the anointing of the feet would indicate the highest honor. Mary may have intended only to show this honor, but this action symbolized Christ’s Messiahship, and had a deeper significance, as our Lord points out (Matthew 26:10; Matthew 26:12).
