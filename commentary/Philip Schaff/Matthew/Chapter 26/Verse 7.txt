Mary may have intended only to show this honor, but this action symbolized Christ’s Messiahship, and had a deeper significance, as our Lord points out (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:10">Matthew 26:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:12">Matthew 26:12</span>).
