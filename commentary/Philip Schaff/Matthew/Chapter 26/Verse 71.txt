<p><strong> SECOND DENIAL</strong>; <strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:71-72">Matthew 26:71-72</span></strong>.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:71">Matthew 26:71</span>. <strong> Into the porch. </strong> In his embarrassing position, he left the fire, going out to the arched gateway leading from the court to the street; probably no further. Mark mentions a crowing of the cock, while he was there (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:30">Mark 14:30</span>). As Peter himself probably informed Mark of this, it was not the cock-crow that brought him to repentance; nor does he conceal his forgetfulness of the signal.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Another maid saw him,</strong> and said unto them that were there. This second recognition seems to have been a general one, beginning by the fire (John, who probably stood there and tells what he himself witnessed), recurring in the porch, where this maid attacked him (Matthew, Mark). If the maid mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:69">Matthew 26:69</span>, was not the porteress, then it is possible that she takes up her banter again. Luke tells of a man recognizing him; probably a servant standing in the porch, one of those to whom the maid spoke. At such a time such a charge would awaken further remark.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Jesus the Nazarene.</strong> Again, a womanâ€™s weapon, of contempt and ridicule; potent enough, when human weakness is not supported by Divine grace.
