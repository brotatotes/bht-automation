<p><strong> THIRD DENIAL, </strong> followed by repentance; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:73-75">Matthew 26:73-75</span>.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:73">Matthew 26:73</span>. <strong> And after a little while. </strong> ‘An hour’ (Luke), so that the second cock-crowing followed immediately (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:74">Matthew 26:74</span>). Peter probably remained in the porch, as a less conspicuous place.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> They that stood by.</strong> A very general recognition by those in the porch. The second denial had allayed the indignation, but the examination was about concluded, and there was more stir and excitement. The first man who recognized him, was probably the one mentioned by Luke; then the bystanders joined in: Surely thou also art one of them, as if to offset his oath (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:72">Matthew 26:72</span>): for even thy speech bewrayeth thee. The Galilean dialect was peculiar, not making a distinction between the guttural sounds, etc.; a ready means of detection. Peter may have talked, while in the porch, with assumed unconcern.
