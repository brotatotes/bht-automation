<p>Our Lord had finished His public work as a Teacher; from this point He appears as High Priest. Matthew brings out this most fully: The events narrated in this section, though not given in chronological order (see note above), are connected in thought. First comes the more definite declaration of our Lord as to the appointed time of His death (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:2">Matthew 26:2</span>). The rulers counsel a postponement (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:3-5">Matthew 26:3-5</span>). But Judas by his treachery (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:14-16">Matthew 26:14-16</span>) is the unconscious means of fulfilling our Lordâ€™s prophecy. The anointing at Bethany, which took place, as narrated by John (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1-8">John 13:1-8</span>), six days before the Passover, is inserted here, because it helped to bring about this result.
