The confession (Matthew 26:16), and the revelation (Matthew 26:21), constitute an epoch in the training of the Apostles. Despite their little faith and want of understanding, they cling to Him as the Christ of God. He calls for a confession of this. Peter, the usual spokesman, makes it. Then He reveals His passion and the sufferings of His people with Him and for His sake. This revelation was at first rejected, never received by the disciples in its full force until it became a fact. The important statement regarding the foundation of His Church (Matthew 26:18) is not, as many suppose, the central thought. It is however appropriately introduced here, where the  confession of the Church  (actively with the mouth, and  passively through suffering for His sake) is made to centre   about His  Passion, the ground and motive for that confession. These events occurred in the neighborhood of Cesarea Philippi, and on the way thither the miracle recorded by Mark (Mark 8:22-26), was performed in Bethsaida Julias. On the very edge of the Jewish territory, these great revelations were made. The hostility of the Jews had banished Him thither, but its ultimate effect would be to banish them from the Land of Promise.
