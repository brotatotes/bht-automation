<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> THE PASSOVER RITES. <strong><em> </em></strong> At the Paschal supper among the Jews from ten to twenty persons gathered as one household. The rites of the feast were regulated by the succession of the cups, filled with red wine, commonly mixed with water. </p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> 1 . <em> Announcement of the Feast</em> The head of the house pronounced the thanksgiving or benediction over the wine and the feast. In the form used the words, ‘fruit of the vine,’ occur. The first cup was then drunk by him, followed by the others. Then the washing of hands, after praise. </p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> 2 . The eating of the bitter herbs, dipped in vinegar or salt water, in remembrance of the sorrows in Egypt. Meanwhile the paschal dishes were brought in the well-seasoned broth (called charoseth), the unleavened loaves, the festal offerings and the lamb. All these things were then explained. They sang the first part of the Hallel, or song of praise (Psalms 113, 114), and the second cup was drunk. </p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> 3 . Then began the feast proper (at which they reclined): the householder took two loaves, broke one in two, laid it upon the whole loaf, blessed it, wrapped it with bitter herbs, dipped it, ate of it, and handed it round with the words: ‘This is the bread of affliction, which our fathers ate in Egypt’ He then blessed the paschal lamb, and ate of it; the festal offerings were eaten with the bread, dipped in the broth; and finally the lamb. The thanksgiving for the meal followed the blessing and drinking of the third cup. </p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> 4 . The remainder of the Hallel was sung (Psalms 115-118), and the fourth cup drunk. </p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> Occasionally a fifth cup followed, while Psalms 120-127 were pronounced, but this was the extreme limit. Little, however, can be deduced from this order in regard to the mode of celebrating the Lord’s Supper. It is probable that with the first cup our Lord made the announcement of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:17-18">Luke 22:17-18</span>. The second cup may have been devoted to the interpretation of the festal act. The third cup, the cup bf thanksgiving, was probably that of the Lord’s Supper.
