THE PREDICTION OF PETER’S DENIAL.   The conversation recorded in Matthew 26:31-35 seems to have taken place on the way across the brook Kedron to Gethsemane. Luke inserts a similar prediction, in connection with the incident about the two swords, which must have taken place before the departure. John too places the prediction before the farewell discourse (chaps, 14 - 17 .), the  whole of which must have been delivered in the room. If there was but one intimation of Peter’s denial, it was at the point where it is placed by Luke. The order is: After the singing of the hymn, the prediction about Peter, then the incident about the swords (in Luke), next John 14:0, then a rising to go (John 14:31), then the remainder of the discourse and the prayer (John 15-17.), then the actual going out. Matthew and Mark, however, connect the prediction of Peter’s denial with another important prophecy, not mentioned by Luke and John, and with difficulty fitted into their narratives. They indicate that the prediction about Peter was occasioned by something else, and record a less presumptuous answer from him. It is probable that our Lord gave  two intimations on this point, the first mentioned by Luke and John (as above), the second by Matthew and Mark, uttered on the way out to Gethsemane. We then have, what would scarcely be lacking, a conversation on the way. The phrase ‘this night ‘favors this view.
