<p>THE THREE TRIALS. <em> </em> These seem to have been three judicial examinations of our Lord.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> ( 1 .) An examination before Annas, who, although deposed, was considered the real high-priest by the Jews, while they were obliged to recognize Caiaphas. This is mentioned by John only (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:13">John 18:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:15">John 18:15</span>, etc.), who followed and went into the palace. It was not formal, no witnesses having been called, but rather an attempt to ensnare our Lord in His own words.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> ( 2 .) The night examination before Caiaphas mentioned in this section. This was formal, in accordance with his official character. Caiaphas, the son-in-law of Annas, probably lived in the same palace with him. This would obviate the difficulties arising from the views of the Jews and the authority of the Romans. The guard seems to have remained in the same palace court during both examinations.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> ( 3 .) In the morning of Friday the final and formal examination before the Sanhedrin (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:1-2">Matthew 27:1-2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:1">Mark 15:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:66">Luke 22:66</span>). Matthew and Mark give the details of the <em> second</em> examination, Luke of the <em> third,</em> John of the <em> first. </em> Peter’s denials occurred during the period from the first to the close of the second examination. John’s account shows this. The other Evangelists treat that subject as a whole, hence Matthew and Mark put it <em> after</em>, and Luke <em> before</em> the examination. A threefold examination by the secular authorities succeeded on Friday morning. These repeated trials were probably caused by a consciousness of the groundlessness of the whole proceeding.
