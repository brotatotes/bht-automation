Matthew 27:11.  How Jesus stood before the governor. In ‘the judgment hall’ (John 18:28), which the Sanhedrin did not enter for the fear of defilement. Failing to get Pilate’s consent without inquiry, they charge Jesus with ‘saying, that he himself is Christ a king’ (Luke 23:2).
	 Art thou the king of the Jews? They had condemned Him for ‘blasphemy,’ but they bring a political accusation now, since Pilate would probably not take notice of the religious one (see John 18:31).
	 Thou sayest,  i.e., ‘ yes.’ He first inquires in what sense Pilate puts the question, and then explains the nature of His kingdom (John 18:34-37  ).  This is implied here. Had Pilate understood it in the political sense, he would not have been so anxious to release Him.
