<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:11">Matthew 27:11</span>. <strong> How Jesus stood before the governor.</strong> In ‘the judgment hall’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:28">John 18:28</span>), which the Sanhedrin did not enter for the fear of defilement. Failing to get Pilate’s consent without inquiry, they charge Jesus with ‘saying, that he himself is Christ a king’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:2">Luke 23:2</span>).
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Art thou the king of the Jews?</strong> They had condemned Him for ‘blasphemy,’ but they bring a political accusation now, since Pilate would probably not take notice of the religious one (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:31">John 18:31</span>).
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Thou sayest,</strong> <em> i.e., ‘</em> yes.’ He first inquires in what sense Pilate puts the question, and then explains the nature of His kingdom (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:34-37">John 18:34-37</span> <em> ). </em> This is implied here. Had Pilate understood it in the political sense, he would not have been so anxious to release Him.
