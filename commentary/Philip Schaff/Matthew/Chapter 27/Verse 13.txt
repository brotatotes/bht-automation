Matthew 27:13.  How many things!  Comp. Luke 22:5, as a specimen of the testimony, or accusations, they brought. The main charge was true in form, but false in fact: His claim to be a king was not a political offence. So as to the evidence: He had stirred up the people, etc., but not to mutiny or for political purposes. Honest advocates at the bar should avoid the tricks of these murderers of Christ.
