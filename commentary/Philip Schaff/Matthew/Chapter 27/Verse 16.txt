<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:16">Matthew 27:16</span>. <strong> A notable prisoner.</strong> A leader in an insurrection in which he had committed murder (Mark and Luke). John calls him ‘a robber.’ Probably one of the Zealots, of whom Josephus speaks. His crime was really political.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Barabbas, </strong> ‘Barabbas,’ <em> i.e.</em>, ‘the son of his father;’ although other meanings have been discovered in it. Some minor authorities call him, ‘Jesus Barabbas,’ and many think he was a false Messiah; but this is a mere conjecture.
