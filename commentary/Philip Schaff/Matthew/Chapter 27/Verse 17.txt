<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> Jesus who is called Christ. </strong> Pilate seems to have known of the Messianic claim. His policy was crooked. He ought to have released Jesus, but he would avoid opposing the council. He chose this expedient, probably with the idea, that the popularity of Jesus would lead the multitude to call for His release. But he was outwitted, or at least mistaken. To put Jesus, as yet uncondemned, on a level with Barabbas, was a crime; a cowardly shirking of responsibility, and a blunder; for this proposal placed Pilate in the power of the Sanhedrin. Pilate was not ‘weak and irresolute;’ but baffled in his purpose by superior cunning. Yet his purpose, like his character, was lacking in moral earnestness; the grand defect of the heathen world at that time. Comp, his question:’ What is truth’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:38">John 18:38</span>), and his mocking tone throughout.
