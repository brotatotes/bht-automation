<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> The judgment seat.</strong> A lofty seat of authority, usually on a stone pavement; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:13">John 19:13</span>. On this occasion he ascended the seat of judgment to receive the decision of the people, in the other case (in John) to mock the Jews and pronounce the final sentence against Jesus.

Tradition gives the name of Pilate’s wife, as <em> Claudia Procula</em> or <em> Procla,</em> and the Apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus says she was a proselyte of the gate, but little weight is to be attached to this.

Her request hints that Pilate might incur Divine vengeance by injuring Jesus. She alone pleads the cause of our Saviour. Compare Plato’s description of the perfectly just man, who ‘without doing any wrong, may assume the appearance of the grossest injustice;’ yea who ‘shall be scourged, tortured, fettered, deprived of his eyes, and after having endured all possible sufferings, fastened to a post, must restore again the beginning and prototype of righteousness.’

The governor’s wife knew something of the mission of Jesus; and the night before, the Sanhedrin had in all probability alarmed the procurator’s household, coming to demand a guard. Pilate’s desire to release Jesus was doubtless increased, but he was already committed to the choice of the people.
