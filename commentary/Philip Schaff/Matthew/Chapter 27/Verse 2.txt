<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Pilate the governor.</strong> The title is a general one; the office held by Pilate was that of Roman ‘procurator’ whose chief business it was to collect the revenues, and in certain cases to administer justice. Palestine had been thus governed since the banishment of Archelaus (A.D. <em> </em> 6 ), and Pilate was the sixth procurator, holding the office for ten years under the Emperor Tiberius (probably from A. D. <em> </em> 27 - 36 ). The usual residence of the procurator was in Cesarea (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:33">Acts 23:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:1">Acts 25:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:4">Acts 25:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:6">Acts 25:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:13">Acts 25:13</span>), but during the great festivals he was generally at Jerusalem, to preserve order and to uphold the supremacy of the Roman power, perhaps also to administer justice. Pilate had an unyielding and severe disposition (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:1">Luke 13:1</span>), and his conduct led to repeated revolts among the Jews, which he suppressed by bloody measures. He was therefore hated and at last removed in consequence of the accusations made against his administration by the Jews. He died by his own hand. There are many legends about him, invented by both the early Christians and their opponents.
