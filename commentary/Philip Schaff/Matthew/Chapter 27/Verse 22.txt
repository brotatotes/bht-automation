But Pilate had placed Jesus on a level with Barabbas and they ask the punishment due to him. They put the Innocent One in the place of the guilty. Thus the details of prophecy in regard to the manner of Christ’s death were to he fulfilled. Contrast this demand with the ‘Hosannas ‘of the previous Sunday. Popular movements which do not rest on <em> moral</em> convictions are as shifting as the sand. The ‘voice of the people,’ when misguided, may be the voice of Satan; yet God overrules even this for good.
