Matthew 27:23.  What evil hath he done? Pilate repeated this question three times, joining with it the proposal to chastise Him and let Him go (Luke 23:22). The only answer is a more excited demand, leading to an uproar. The persistence of Pilate shows his real desire to release Jesus. But the multitude felt that Pilate, by his previous proposal, was committed to a decision against Jesus. Hence a governor, representing the proud Roman power, the nation of legal enactments, was forced to parley with a mob, which at another time he would have crushed with the severest measures. When Christ is to be crucified, no alliance of godless men is impossible, Comp. Luke 23:12.
