Matthew 27:25.  His blood,  i.e., the guilt of the punishment, if He be innocent,  be upon us. Pilate formally puts the responsibility upon them; but in a fanatical hate they assume it themselves, even adding,  and on our children. Peculiar to Matthew, who wrote mainly for Jewish Christians. The imprecation has been a fearful legacy from that generation. But the curse will be turned to a blessing, and the blood of Christ be on that people in its cleansing, healing power (Romans 11:25-26). As the persecutions of the Jews have been mainly through unjust civil enactments, compare the last cry of the chief priests: ‘We have no king but Cesar’ (John 19:15).
