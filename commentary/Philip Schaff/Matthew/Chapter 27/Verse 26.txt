Scourging usually preceded crucifixion. As Pilate made further attempts to release Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:4-15">John 19:4-15</span>), some have thought that this scourging was not the one which usually preceded crucifixion, but a distinct punishment others even think that our Lord suffered twice from the lash. Pilate probably ordered the usual scourging, hoping still to release Jesus. He then showed Him (Ecce Homo) to the people, but in vain, as he might have known, for he had (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:16">Luke 23:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:22">Luke 23:22</span>) already twice proposed this punishment. Roman scourging was a fearful punishment. The entire body was bared, the lashes were given without number, thus differing from the Jewish mode. It could not be inflicted upon a Roman citizen (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:25">Acts 22:25</span>), but was for slaves. In this case it was inflicted by soldiers. So that the whips were thongs with lead or bones attached. The prisoner was usually bound in a stooping posture so that the skin of the back was stretched tightly; as their backs were flayed by the process, they frequently fainted, and sometimes died. The soldiers, who afterwards mocked Him, were not likely to be mild in this case. Yet the representative of civil justice proposed this as a milder punishment for One who was innocent.

Thus Pilate sacrificed his independent position as a representative of the Roman law, to the fanaticism of the Jewish hierarchy. The State became a tool in the hands of an apostate and bloodthirsty Church. Pilateâ€™s conduct is an awful warning to rulers, who to gain popularity pander to religious fanaticism. His political fall was due to the accusation of these very people.
