From Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:16">Mark 15:16</span>) we learn that it was into the court (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:68">Matthew 26:68</span>). The word <em> praetorium </em> was applied first to the general’s tent in the Roman camp, then to the residence of the provincial governors, who were usually generals. Pilate,, when in Jerusalem, probably lived in the former palace of Herod, ‘on the northern brow of Zion, overlooking the enclosure of the temple, and connected with it by a bridge’ (J. A. Alexander). But Lange thinks that Herod Antipas would probably have occupied this, and Pilate the castle Antonia.

It was probably in the open guardroom of the cohort, but this does not prove that the place was the castle Antonia.
