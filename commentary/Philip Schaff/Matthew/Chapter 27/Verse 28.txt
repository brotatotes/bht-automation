Some ancient authorities read ‘clothed him.’ His clothing was replaced after the scourging, and probably also the robe which Herod had put on Him to mock Him (Luke 23:11), usually supposed to have been white, marking Him as a  candidate for royal honors. This robe was removed, and instead they put on him a scarlet robe, the sign of His having attained royal honors. It was probably an ordinary military cloak. Mark and John speak of it as ‘purple;’ but imperial or royal purple is more scarlet than blue.
