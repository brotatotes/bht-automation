Matthew 27:3.  Then Judas. Probably on Friday morning.
	 When he saw.  This he could see from the procession to Pilate’s judgment-hall.
	 That he was condemned.  That Judas did not expect this issue, seems contrary to the words of his confession (Matthew 27:4). This circumstance shows that his object was not to induce Jesus to display His glory; in that case his repentance would have led him to Christ and not to suicide.
	 Repented himself,  felt sorrow or remorse; not the word usually translated ‘repent.’ Remorse is c  aused by the consequences of sin; repentance is only  occasioned by them; in remorse the sorrow is for the  consequences, in repentance for the  cause, and the sin itself. A terrible prophecy respecting the fate of the betrayer (chap. Matthew 26:24) had been joined with the prediction of this effect of the treachery. As the latter had been fulfilled, Judas must have felt the terrors springing from the former.
	 Brought back the thirty pieces of silver.  He probably received them during the night. Peter first repented in solitude before God; Judas attempted some rectification before men. The bringing back of the money really supports the view that his one great motive was avarice. Remorse, calling for rectification before men, would point to the moving cause of his crime. It is unlikely that more was to have been paid him.
