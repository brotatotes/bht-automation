<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Two robbers.</strong> Probably associates of Barabbas, and hence placed on either side of Jesus, who had taken the punishment due to Barabbas. This proceeding carries out the mockery implied in the title; these two representing the subjects of ‘the King of the Jews.’ The usual punishment for robbery was crucifixion.
