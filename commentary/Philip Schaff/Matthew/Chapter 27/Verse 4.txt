<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:4">Matthew 27:4</span>. <strong> I sinned.</strong> <em> ‘</em> Erred’ is too weak. Although Judas had no real conception of the sinfulness of sin, his feeling was intense. All notions that he tried to make his guilt appear small seem to come from wrong views of his motives and of his remorse. Fearful sorrow for the consequences of sin may coexist with entire sinfulness.

<p><strong> In that I</strong> <strong> betrayed</strong> <em> , </em> lit, ‘in betraying,’ <strong> innocent blood.</strong> <em> </em> No sign of affection for his Master, but even Judas may testify to the sinless perfection of our Lord. Nothing in the three years’ intercourse could now be used to appease his conscience.

<p><strong> What is that to us?</strong> see thou to it. Tools of crime are lightly thrown away after the crime. The rulers have no remorse. Was Judas then worse than his employers?
