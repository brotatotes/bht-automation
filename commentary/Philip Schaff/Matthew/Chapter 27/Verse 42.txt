Matthew 27:42.  He saved others. This may be ironical, or it is a recognition of His miracles of mercy, to taunt Him with a supposed loss of power just when He needed it most for Himself. His very mercy is used in mockery.
	 He is the king of Israel, etc. Ironical, with a mocking suggestion of still being open to the proof of His Messiahship.
	 And we will believe on him.  Unless there was an  atoning purpose in Christâ€™s death, it will always seem strange that He did not offer some such miraculous proof of His power. The soldiers repeated this reproach, but of course without this last clause (see Luke 23:36-37).
