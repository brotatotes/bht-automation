Matthew 27:43.  He trusteth on God. In their mockery they repeat almost the very language of Psalms 22:8. Their Pharisaical scrupulousness made them substitute ‘God’ for ‘Jehovah,’ which occurs in the Psalm, and which the Jews would not utter. Yet that Psalm was now finding its fulfilment, and the verse they echo is preceded by a description (Matthew 27:7) of their very gestures. See Matthew 27:46.
