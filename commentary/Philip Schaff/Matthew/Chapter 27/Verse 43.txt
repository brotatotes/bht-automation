Their Pharisaical scrupulousness made them substitute ‘God’ for ‘Jehovah,’ which occurs in the Psalm, and which the Jews would not utter. Yet that Psalm was now finding its fulfilment, and the verse they echo is preceded by a description (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:7">Matthew 27:7</span>) of their very gestures. See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:46">Matthew 27:46</span>.
