<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> And they that ware with him. </strong> The soldiers, as is evident from the phrase: watching him. Mark and Luke speak of the centurion only, the latter adding the general consternation of other spectators.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The things that were done, </strong> <em> i.e</em>. <em> ,</em> how Jesus died, as Mark tells us. The two accounts supplement each other, but show the usual independence.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Truly this was the Son of God, </strong> or, ‘God’s Son.’ The heathen officer may have used these words in the heathen sense: hero or demigod; but this is not probable. For he had heard this accusation, must have known something of Jewish opinion; heathen became Christians through the preaching of the cross, why not through the sight of the dying Redeemer. Such a conversion would be thus indicated. Nor is it certain that this phrase meant demigod. It might be the germ of a Christian confession without being expressed in the full form, <em> the</em> Son of God. Comp, the statement of Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:47">Luke 23:47</span>) which does not oppose this view. Only the centurion thus spoke, but as the soldiers ‘feared, some decided spiritual effect may have been produced on them also.
