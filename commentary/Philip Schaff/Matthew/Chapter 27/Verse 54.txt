Matthew 27:54.  The centurion,  who superintended the execution.

Such a conversion would be thus indicated. Nor is it certain that this phrase meant demigod. It might be the germ of a Christian confession without being expressed in the full form,  the Son of God.

Only the centurion thus spoke, but as the soldiers ‘feared, some decided spiritual effect may have been produced on them also.
