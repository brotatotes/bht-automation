<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:57">Matthew 27:57</span>. <strong> When evening was come.</strong> The first evening before sundown, at which time the bodies must be removed (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+21:23">Deuteronomy 21:23</span>). Our Lord’s death took place at three in the afternoon.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> There came a rich man.</strong> Probably, to the company of women standing on Golgotha (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:56">Matthew 27:56</span>). His going to Pilate is mentioned afterwards. The fact of his being a ‘rich man’ is mentioned here, in allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:9">Isaiah 53:9</span>: ‘With the rich in His death.’
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Of Arimathea.</strong> Either Ramah in Benjamin (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jos+18:25">Joshua 18:25</span>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:18">Matthew 2:18</span>) or Ramah (Ramathaim) in Ephraim, the birth-place of Samuel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1sa+1:19">1 Samuel 1:19</span>). The form favors the latter view; the addition of Luke: ‘a city of the Jews’ the former.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Named Joseph.</strong> One Joseph takes care of Jesus in His infancy, another provides for His burial. Jesus’ disciple. ‘Secretly for fear of the Jews’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:38">John 19:38</span>). He was a member of the Sanhedrin, of high character, who had not consented to the murder (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:50-51">Luke 23:50-51</span>). He seems to have feared that the body might be removed in a disgraceful manner, and his secret faith having been quickened, he took a decisive step. Ecclesiastical tradition makes him one of ‘the seventy’ and the first who preached the gospel in England.
