The first day of the Passover (Friday) was in one sense a Sabbath, hence this designation is more definite. It is also supposed that the word ‘preparation’ was the solemn designation in use among the Christians to distinguish the Friday of the crucifixion (Meyer).

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Gathared together.</strong> On Saturday morning; the great Sabbath of the year, as the verse plainly states. While our Lord rested in the tomb, they desecrated the Sabbath, despite their great scrupulousness. It is urged that this must have taken place on Friday evening after six o’clock, since the rulers would guard against the stealing away on the first night as well as on the subsequent one. But their anxiety was about the night preceding the third day (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:64">Matthew 27:64</span>). Besides the women were evidently not aware of the presence of the guard (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:3">Mark 16:3</span>). This is accounted for, if we suppose that this incident occurred on Saturday, and not on Friday evening after six o’clock.
