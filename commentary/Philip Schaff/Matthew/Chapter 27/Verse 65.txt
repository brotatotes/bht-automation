Matthew 27:65.  Ye have a guard, or, ‘have a guard,’  i.e., I permit you to take one. The Roman soldiers, who certainly composed the guard (chap. Matthew 28:14), were not under their command.
	 Make it sure as ye know how. Not ‘as sure as ye can,’ nor is it at all ironical. He gives them the guard, and they are to use the means as they think best. Pilate shirks the responsibility, but again gives way. Yet this was overruled for good.
