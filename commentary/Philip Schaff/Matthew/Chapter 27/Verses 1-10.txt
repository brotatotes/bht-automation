<p>This morning meeting of the Sanhedrin is mentioned more particularly by Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:66-71">Luke 22:66-71</span>). They must apply to the Roman governor to have their formal sentence against Jesus executed. They first decide how to proceed (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:1">Matthew 27:1</span>), and then the actual delivery took place (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:2">Matthew 27:2</span>). The account of the remorse and suicide of Judas is peculiar to Matthew, although referred to in Peterâ€™s speech after the Ascension (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:16-19">Acts 1:16-19</span>). Its insertion in connection with the prophecy quoted, accords with the character of this Gospel. The repentance of Peter and the remorse of Judas stand close together, in the narrative before us, as if to contrast them. They actually occurred in quick succession, although Matthew, to close the subject, adds events that must have happened later (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:7">Matthew 27:7</span>).
