Matthew 27:52-53.  The tombs were opened.  The Jewish tombs, unlike our own, were natural or artificial excavations in rocks, the entrance being closed by a door or a large stone. These, the stone doors of the tombs, were removed, probably by the force of the earthquake, to testify that Christ’s death had burst the bands of death.
	 That had fallen asleep.  Comp. 1 Corinthians 15:18; 1 Thessalonians 4:15.
	 Were raised. Matthew alone mentions this. The next verse indicates that the actual rising did not take place until ‘after His resurrection.’ This remarkable event was both supernatural and symbolic, proclaiming the truth that the death and resurrection of Christ was a victory over death and Hades, opening the door to everlasting life. Who these ‘saints ‘were, is doubtful. Perhaps saints of the olden times, but more probably those personally known to the disciples, as seems implied in the phrase: appeared unto many. Such saints as Simeon, Anna, Zachariah, Joseph, John the Baptist, or open friends of Christ, it has been suggested. Whether they died again is also doubtful. But probably not, as the next verse intimates an appearance for a time, not such a restoration as in the case of Lazarus, and others. They may have had glorified bodies and ascended with our Lord. Not much has been revealed, but enough to proclaim and confirm the blessed truth of which the event is a sign and seal. Jerusalem is still called ‘the holy city,’ a title it could retain at least until the day of Pentecost.
