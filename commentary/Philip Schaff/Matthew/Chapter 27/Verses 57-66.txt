<p>OUR LORD’S INTENSE AGONY OF MIND <em> </em> no doubt hastened death, although viewed in another aspect, it may be said, that the Saviour hastened His death by a voluntary self-surrender which the Father accepted (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:46">Luke 23:46</span>). The evidence of His death to the soldiers was the incident mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:34">John 19:34</span>. This early death was unusual (comp. Pilate’s surprise, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:44">Mark 15:44</span>), but thus the Scripture was fulfilled (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:36-37">John 19:36-37</span>). The request of the Jews is also mentioned in John’s account. This was the first step towards burial, a legal scruple of His murderers: then follows the request of Joseph of Arimathea and the events as recorded in the section before us. The burial, as an important fact, is mentioned by all four Evangelists; the sealing and guarding of the sepulchre, with the request which led to these precautions, are peculiar to Matthew. The objections which have been urged against the accuracy of these details, are readily answered.
