<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:13">Matthew 28:13</span>. <strong> Stole him away while we slept</strong>. The story carries its refutation on its face. If all the soldiers were asleep, they could not discover the thieves, nor would they have proclaimed their negligence, the punishment for which was death; if even a few of them were awake, they might and would have prevented the theft. A few timid disciples would not have made such an attempt. But men in the infatuation of unbelief, will believe any story however improbable.
