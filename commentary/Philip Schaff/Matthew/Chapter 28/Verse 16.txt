<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:16">Matthew 28:16</span>. <strong> But the eleven disciples</strong>. As this meeting was appointed before our Lord’s death (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:32">Matthew 26:32</span>) as the message of the angel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:7">Matthew 28:7</span>), repeated by our Lord Himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:10">Matthew 28:10</span> was probably addressed to the whole body of disciples, and as the language of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:17">Matthew 28:17</span> (‘some doubted’) could scarcely apply to the eleven, we infer that all the disciples who could be brought together were assembled on this occasion, identifying it with the appearance mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:6">1 Corinthians 15:6</span> (‘five hundred brethren at once’). It was probably the <em> eighth</em> appearance, preceded by that at the Sea of Galilee (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:0">John 21:0</span>). ‘The eleven disciples’ are mentioned as representatives of the entire band.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Went into Galilee</strong> <em> .</em> Probably on the Monday after the Pass-over feast had closed, nine days after the resurrection.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them. Evidently</strong> a definite place of meeting, but exactly when and where is unknown. An apocryphal tradition of a late date ( 13 th century) says that the mountain was the northern peak of the Mount of Olives, which it is asserted, was called <em> Galilea.</em> But this is a useless attempt at harmonizing the accounts. There was a good reason for the withdrawal into the district of Galilee, remote from Jerusalem. Some conjecture that it was Mount Tabor. Were a knowledge of the locality important, it would have been pointed out to us as definitely as it was appointed to believers then.
