<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:17">Matthew 28:17</span>. <strong> They worshipped him</strong> <em> .</em> The word might mean something less than religious worship, but it does mean that in many cases; the matter could scarcely be mentioned, if it meant less here.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> But some doubted.</strong> A few, probably of the five hundred, not of the ‘eleven.’ Some say the doubt was respecting the identity of our Lord, and find in it an evidence of their caution in examining the evidence, which gives their subsequent conviction and testimony the greater weight. But they came there because they thought He was risen, and the sight of the Lord had <em> in all other cases</em> produced conviction. The doubt was probably whether it was proper to worship Him, especially as the following words of our Lord apply so directly to such a doubt. So now ‘some,’ attached to our Lord, have a speculative doubt as to the propriety of according Him Divine honors. When it becomes a positive denial of the power He claims in the next verse, genuine faith in Him is scarcely possible.
