<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:18">Matthew 28:18</span>. <strong> And Jesus came to them</strong> <em> .</em> He may have been seen first at a distance, or He may now have approached those who doubted.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> All authority was given to me in heaven and on earth. An</strong> expression of His glorification and victory. The primary reference is to His authority as Mediator, extending over all in heaven and on earth, <em> for His Church.</em> It ‘was given’ by the Father, to Him as the God-man, though as the Eternal Word, He had such glory before the foundation of the world. Before the resurrection the disciples were not ready for this revelation, nor had the victory of the God-man been won. Hence to exalt the truths spoken by our Lord before His death above those which He uttered after His resurrection, or taught His disciples through this power, is to lose the full glory of the gospel. Our Lord now announces the fact, but this victory was won at the Resurrection. He lingers on earth to assure His chosen ones, and at the ascension enters into his Inheritance.
