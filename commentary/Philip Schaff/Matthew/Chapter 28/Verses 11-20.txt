<p>The two incidents of this section seem to have been placed together, to mark a contrast Judaism reaches its lowest point, when it must bribe heathen soldiers to lie for it. Matthew would thus lead the minds of the Jewish Christians, for whom he wrote, away from the desecrated mount in Jerusalem, to the mount in Galilee, where our Lord proclaims His glory and power. The Gospel closes with a command and a promise (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:20">Matthew 28:20</span>) to those who should go forth as despised Nazarenes (Galileans), the fulfilment of which not only proves the falsity of the rulersâ€™ story, but left Judaism forever impotent. It is a fitting close for all time. For on the fulfilment of the promise, always connected with obedience to the command, rests the proof of the whole simple narrative.
