Matthew 3:12.  Whose winnowing-shovel,  etc. A new figure, including a reference both to the saved and the lost; ‘the axe’ referred to the latter alone. The ‘winnowing-shovel,’ for separating the chaff and the wheat, was ready for use,  in his hand,  and thus equipped,  he will cleanse thoroughly  (from one end to the other)  his threshing floor.  The threshing floor was a circular space on the farm, either beaten hard or paved, where the grain was trodden out by oxen or horses. The threshing floor of the Messiah becomes larger as the course of history moves on. The thorough cleansing of the floor itself will be completed when the end of the world comes, but the process of winnowing is included,  i.e.,  the disciplinary and punitive leadings of God with men.
	 And he will gather.  The punctuation of the common version should be altered. The cleansing process is spoken of first in general, then the twofold result is set forth in contrasted clauses.
	 His wheat,  the fruits of the husbandry, the persons saved, hence ‘His.’
	 The garner,  the storehouse; either the kingdom of heaven on earth, or heaven itself, probably both, since Christ’s salvation includes both words.
	 The chaff,  the refuse, not ‘His,’ when separated will be burned up. As in the case of the ‘wheat,’ persons are meant, and the punishment may begin, like the blessing, in this world.
	 Fire unquenchable.  The violent, uncontrollable blaze of a straw fire is the figurative representation of an awful reality. Once begun, the fiery   judgment continues, until the unquenchable fire of Gehenna is kindled.
