<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:14">Matthew 3:14</span>. <strong> But John would have hindered him. </strong> Peculiar to Matthew. Began to hinder Him, by act <strong> </strong> rather than word. <strong> I have need, </strong> continuous, habitual need.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Comest thou to me? </strong> A question of surprise, implying a recognition of Jesus as the Messiah. John’s knowledge of Jesus was sufficient to occasion the question. His subsequent declaration (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:33">John 1:33</span>): ‘I knew him not,’ does not contradict this. He had not yet received the sign from heaven that would enable him <strong> </strong> to authoritatively proclaim Jesus as the Messiah. Compare the very decided declarations made by the Baptist immediately afterwards.</p>
