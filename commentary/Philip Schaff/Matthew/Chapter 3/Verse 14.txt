Matthew 3:14.  But John would have hindered him.  Peculiar to Matthew. Began to hinder Him, by act   rather than word.  I have need,  continuous, habitual need.
	 Comest thou to me?  A question of surprise, implying a recognition of Jesus as the Messiah. John’s knowledge of Jesus was sufficient to occasion the question. His subsequent declaration (John 1:33): ‘I knew him not,’ does not contradict this. He had not yet received the sign from heaven that would enable him   to authoritatively proclaim Jesus as the Messiah. Compare the very decided declarations made by the Baptist immediately afterwards.
