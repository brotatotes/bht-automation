Matthew 3:15.  Suffer it now.  The propriety of John’s scruples is recognized; but he was ‘now’   or ‘as yet’ the minister of the law, which Jesus must fulfil. The relation between them would soon be changed.
	 It becometh us.  Both John in his office and Jesus in His.
	 Righteousnes.  The requirements of the law, regarded as including all that is right.
	 Suffereth him.  More than ‘he baptized him’; Jesus was really the active person, since the rite was administered at His command and by His authority.
