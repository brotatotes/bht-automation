Baptism was essentially a symbolical or <strong> </strong> ceremonial washing, prescribed at first by the Mosaic law, as a sign of moral renovation, joined with sacrifice. John may have derived his rite from Christian baptism. Those who had received John’s baptism were rebaptized (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:4">Acts 19:4</span>); Christ himself was the subject of the rite, as a Jew (see next section), while it had a more profound significance than the ceremonial lustration, yet it was not a baptism ‘unto his death’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:3">Romans 6:3</span>), but ‘unto repentance’ (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</span>). Details of external form are not made prominent in the religion of Christ. If the rite is not identical with Christian baptism, the mode practised by John cannot conclusively determine the proper mode of Christian baptism. The subjects went into the river and were either immersed by John, or water was poured on them. The Greek verb <em> baptize</em> (from the root <em> bapto, to dip)</em> is a technical term for a symbolical washing, with a view to spiritual purification. It is better in any case to retain the word ‘baptize,’ as marking more distinctly this technical sense.
