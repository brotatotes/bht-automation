Matthew 3:8.  Bring forth therefore.  ‘Therefore,’  i.e., if you are really fleeing as you profess to be, then bring forth fruit   (the singular is found in the original)  worthy of repentance  (or,  your repentance). The fruit or result, worthy of repentance, implies a good tree to produce the fruit. The germ of the great gospel truth: ‘Ye must be born again,’ since natural birth, or descent from Abraham (Matthew 3:9), did not insure the worthy fruit.
