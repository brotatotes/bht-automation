<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:8">Matthew 3:8</span>. <strong> Bring forth therefore. </strong> ‘Therefore,’ <em> i.e.</em>, if you are really fleeing as you profess to be, then bring forth fruit <strong> </strong> (the singular is found in the original) <strong> worthy of repentance </strong> (or, <em> your</em> repentance). The fruit or result, worthy of repentance, implies a good tree to produce the fruit. The germ of the great gospel truth: ‘Ye must be born again,’ since natural birth, or descent from Abraham (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:9">Matthew 3:9</span>), did not insure the worthy fruit.</p>
