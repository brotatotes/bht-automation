Matthew 3:9.  Think not to say,  or, ‘that you may say.’ Do not say, nay, do not think that this is a plausible defence, even  within yourselves,  in your own hearts:  We have Abraham to our father,  or ‘for a father,’  i.e., we shall escape, or be saved, because we are natural heirs to the promise made to him. This was the Jewish boast, the Jewish error; John’s preaching went to the heart of the matter.
	 For.  The reason the Jewish boast was not valid.
	 God is able of  (or, ‘out of’)  these stones,   i.e., lying loose on the banks of Jordan, where the words were uttered sarcastic. No figurative reference to heathen, or to monuments.
	 To raise up children unto Abraham.  Very emphatic. God could create others to take their place as heirs of the promise. Probably a reference to the spiritual offspring of the patriarch (Romans 4:16; Galatians 3:7). John, either consciously or unconsciously, predicts the calling of the Gentiles. Spiritual succession not dependent on natural or ecclesiastical (even ‘apostolic’) succession.
