<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:9">Matthew 3:9</span>. <strong> Think not to say, </strong> or, ‘that you may say.’ Do not say, nay, do not think that this is a plausible defence, even <strong> within yourselves, </strong> in your own hearts: <strong> We have Abraham to our father, </strong> or ‘for a father,’ <em> i.e.,</em> we shall escape, or be saved, because we are natural heirs to the promise made to him. This was the Jewish boast, the Jewish error; John’s preaching went to the heart of the matter.

<p style="margin-left:0.3em;"><strong> For. </strong> The reason the Jewish boast was not valid.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.3em;"><strong> God is able of </strong> (or, ‘out of’) <strong> these stones, </strong> <em> i.e.,</em> lying loose on the banks of Jordan, where the words were uttered sarcastic. No figurative reference to heathen, or to monuments.

<p style="margin-left:0.3em;"><strong> To raise up children unto Abraham. </strong> Very emphatic. God could create others to take their place as heirs of the promise. Probably a reference to the spiritual offspring of the patriarch (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:16">Romans 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:7">Galatians 3:7</span>). John, either consciously or unconsciously, predicts the calling of the Gentiles. Spiritual succession not dependent on natural or ecclesiastical (even ‘apostolic’) succession.</p>
