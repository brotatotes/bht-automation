<p>John the Baptist, his mission, character, and preaching. The section takes up the Old Testament prophecy (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:3">Matthew 3:3</span>), and concludes with an announcement of the coming Messiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11-12">Matthew 3:11-12</span>), whose baptism is next recorded. John combines the characters of Moses and Isaiah, joins law and promise in his preaching; the last of the Old Testament and nearest to the New (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:11">Matthew 11:11</span>). He decreases that Christ may increase (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:30">John 3:30</span>); preaches the law (repentance), because the gospel is at hand (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>); stern in rebuke of sinners (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7">Matthew 3:7</span>), he is poor in spirit before the Saviour (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</span>). A herald of the kingdom (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>), yet not of it (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:11">Matthew 11:11</span>), he came in the spirit and power of Elijah (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:17">Luke 1:17</span>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:14">Matthew 11:14</span>), to be the connecting link between the Old and New Dispensations. His inspiration (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:2">Luke 3:2</span>: ‘the word of God came to John,’ the Old Testament formula) was ‘more of a sudden overpowering influence, as in the prophets, than a gentle indwelling, manifested through the individual character, as in the apostles and evangelists’ (Alford). His doubts about the mission of Christ (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:3">Matthew 11:3</span>) recall the impatience of Elijah, at Horeb (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:0">1 Kings 19:0</span>). Yet his baptism had a greater significance than the Mosaic ritual washings, and his preaching was an advance on all previous teaching. The former culminated in the baptism of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:15-17">Matthew 3:15-17</span>), the latter in the announcement, ‘Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>) <em> .</em></p>
