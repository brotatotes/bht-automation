The  culmination of the ministry of John in the baptism of Jesus. The accompanying attestation: to John, a revelation that this was the Christ; to Jesus his  Messianic inauguration. It therefore marks an epoch in the Gospel history, and doubtless in the consciousness of the God-Man Himself (see notes on Matthew 3:16-17). While fulfilling all righteousness (Matthew 3:15), the well-beloved Son receives witness from the Father (Matthew 3:17), and is baptized with the Holy Ghost (Matthew 3:16). A solemn introduction into His public ministry.
