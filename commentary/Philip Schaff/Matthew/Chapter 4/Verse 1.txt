Matthew 4:1.  Then,  immediately after the events mentioned in the last chapter, as Mark more explicitly states. After marked evidence of Divine favor, the most trying conflicts.
	 Led up by the Spirit.  Not by His own spirit, but by the Holy Spirit. The words ‘led up’ show this.
	 Into the wilderness.  What wilderness, is a question of no special importance. Tradition points to a high and precipitous mountain near Jericho, close by the banks of the Jordan, called Quarantania, from the forty days’ fast. This is the more probable locality; but our Lord, like Moses and Elijah, may have gone to the Sinaitic wilderness.  To be tempted.  For this purpose. To this contest, the God-Man is impelled, not directly by his own will, but by the Spirit to fulfil the design of the Father. According to his human nature, Jesus could be tempted, was in need of trial. Through this he passed without sin (Hebrews 4:15).
	 By the devil.  The Greek word means slanderer, accuser. In the Old Testament he is called Satan, or adversary. A person, not a principle or influence, as is evident, from the whole tenor of Scripture. The personal representatives of the two kingdoms here met. As Christ was in human form, it is natural to suppose the adversary took some bodily form. What form is not stated, nor is it material. The views which regard the temptation as purely internal do not require any bodily appearance. Some suppose that ‘the tempter,’ Matthew 4:3, was a member of the Sanhedrin, presenting, as the special instrument of the devil, the prevalent false Messianic notions of the Jews. But ‘the devil’ is expressly mentioned in the second and third temptations; the suggestion of Matthew 4:9 could not be made with any power by a Jew; Matthew 4:10 speaks of Satan by name.
