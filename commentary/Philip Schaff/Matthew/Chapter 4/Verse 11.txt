Others think, ‘gave him spiritual companionship,’ to support Him and prove that ‘man doth not live by bread alone.’ The view that the angels brought Him food, accords better with the events just narrated. He who would not turn stones into bread was now fed; He who would not call upon angels to uphold Him in rash confidence, was now sustained by them; He who demanded worship for God alone, received homage from these servants of God.
