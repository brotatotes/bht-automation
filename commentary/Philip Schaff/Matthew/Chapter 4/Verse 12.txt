Matthew 4:12.  When he heard,   i.e., in Judea.
	 Delivered up,   i.e., into prison by Herod the tetrarch. The common version gives an explanation, not a literal translation. For reason of this imprisonment, see chap. Matthew 14:4;  Mark 6:17.
	 He withdrew into Galilee.  A withdrawal from prudence (as chap. Matthew 2:12; Matthew 2:22), hinting that He had been teaching in Judea. ‘Galilee’: here the whole region of that name, since Nazareth was in lower Galilee. In John 4:43-45, it means upper Galilee, or Galilee in the stricter sense. Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, hence the withdrawal was not through fear of him. It was due to the opposition of the Pharisees (John 4:1; John 5:16; John 5:18, if that occurrence preceded).
