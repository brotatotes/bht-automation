<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Delivered up, </strong> <em> i.e.,</em> into prison by Herod the tetrarch. The common version gives an explanation, not a literal translation. For reason of this imprisonment, see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:4">Matthew 14:4</span>; <strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:17">Mark 6:17</span></strong>.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> He withdrew into Galilee. </strong> A withdrawal from prudence (as chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:12">Matthew 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:22">Matthew 2:22</span>), hinting that He had been teaching in Judea. ‘Galilee’: here the whole region of that name, since Nazareth was in lower Galilee. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:43-45">John 4:43-45</span>, it means upper Galilee, or Galilee in the stricter sense. Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, hence the withdrawal was not through fear of him. It was due to the opposition of the Pharisees (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:1">John 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:16">John 5:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:18">John 5:18</span>, if that occurrence preceded).</p>
