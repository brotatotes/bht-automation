<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> In Capernaum. </strong> A thriving commercial place on the northwestern shore of the sea (or lake) of Galilee, hence called here ‘the maritime,’ which is the literal meaning of the word paraphrased: <strong> which is on the shore of the lake. </strong> Mentioned, not to distinguish it, but on account of the prophecy which follows. It was also <strong> in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali. </strong> The exact site of Capernaum, so often mentioned in the New Testament, is disputed; the words of our Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:23">Matthew 11:23</span>) have thus been fulfilled. Some locate it at Khan Minyeh, at the northern end of the Plain of Gennesaret (El-Ghuweir), near the Fountain of the Fig-Tree, and on the present highway to Damascus; others two or three miles further north, at Tell Hum, which is more probable on account of the very remarkable ruins, including a white synagogue (carefully examined and described by Capt. Wilson, 1866 ), and on account of the similarity of the name (Tell Hum means ‘Hill of Nahum,’ and Capernaum ‘Village of Nahum’). Capernaum was an important place, the residence of Andrew, Peter, and the sons of Zebedee, probably of Matthew also, chiefly honored by the title, ‘His own city’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:1">Matthew 9:1</span>).
