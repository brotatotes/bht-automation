<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:15">Matthew 4:15</span>. <em> </em> <strong> The land of Zebulun</strong> <em> , </em> etc. <strong> </strong> These words form the close of a sentence in the original prophecy, and are introduced to specify the region spoken of in this Messianic prediction. Either an apostrophe to these regions or equivalent to: as to the land of Zebulun, etc. The sense is the same.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> By the way of the sea</strong>. The sea (or lake) of Galilee, not the Mediterranean. The latter view would indicate that the region was profane, being the way of the sea for all the world. But this seems forced.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Beyond Jordan</strong>, or ‘the Jordan.’ Either the country on the west side already spoken of, or Perea on the east side. (Both senses are sustained by Old Testament usage.) The former is preferable, since the various terms of the verse seem to be in apposition. Some take this verse as describing the regions surrounding the lake (referring this to Perea), but Naphtali extended beyond the sources of the Jordan, i.e., northward from Jerusalem.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Galilee of the Gentiles</strong>. Upper Galilee, already spoken of by other names. It was near Gentile territory and probably had a large Gentile population.
