The call is thus expanded: ‘ 1 . An invitation to full communion with Him; 2 . A demand of perfect self-renunciation for His sake; 3 . An announcement of a new sphere of activity under Him; 4 . A promise of rich reward from Him. The call of Jesus to follow Him, 1 . A call to faith; 2 . A call to labor; 3 . A call to suffering and cross-bearing; 4 . A call to our blessed home.’ (Lange.)This call to personal attendance, probably in all cases preceded the call to the apostleship. Even this office did not obtain full validity until the day of Pentecost, when the Church was organized, or, strictly speaking, reorganized. The Twelve were gradually prepared for their work. Paul’s case is exceptional.

A. Alexander.) Our Lord uses human agents; even He did not labor alone. Let no one assume to be independent of others in any good work.</p>
