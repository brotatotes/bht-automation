Matthew 4:19.  Come ye after me.  This call is to be distinguished from the previous acquaintanceship and discipleship (John 1:0), and also from the later choice and call to the apostleship (Matthew 10:0). The call is thus expanded: ‘ 1 . An invitation to full communion with Him; 2 . A demand of perfect self-renunciation for His sake; 3 . An announcement of a new sphere of activity under Him; 4 . A promise of rich reward from Him. The call of Jesus to follow Him, 1 . A call to faith; 2 . A call to labor; 3 . A call to suffering and cross-bearing; 4 . A call to our blessed home.’ (Lange.)This call to personal attendance, probably in all cases preceded the call to the apostleship.

A. Alexander.) Our Lord uses human agents; even He did not labor alone. Let no one assume to be independent of others in any good work.
