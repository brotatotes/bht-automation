Matthew 4:20.  Straightway  (the same word as in Matthew 4:22). Emphatic; there was no delay. Luke tells of a miraculous draught of fishes, which preceded and prepared the fishermen to obey. His narrative assumes that Jesus was known to them (Luke 5:5), and that they gave up their occupation to follow our Lord constantly.
