<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:20">Matthew 4:20</span>. <strong> Straightway </strong> (the same word as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:22">Matthew 4:22</span>). Emphatic; there was no delay. Luke tells of a miraculous draught of fishes, which preceded and prepared the fishermen to obey. His narrative assumes that Jesus was known to them (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:5">Luke 5:5</span>), and that they gave up their occupation to follow our Lord constantly.</p>
