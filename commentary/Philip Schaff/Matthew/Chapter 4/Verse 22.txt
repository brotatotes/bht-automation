Matthew 4:22. These two brothers  straightway  obeyed, leaving  their father also.  He was probably not poor, as he had ‘hired servants’ (Mark 1:20). The lesson, more plainly taught elsewhere, is: Renounce every human tie, if necessary, to follow Christ. Yet human ties are not severed by following Christ. The brothers remained brethren in the Lord, and these four companions in fishing were joined most closely as ‘fishers of men.’ Comp. Mark 13:3.
