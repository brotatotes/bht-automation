<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:25">Matthew 4:25</span>. <strong> Great multitudes, </strong> lit, ‘many crowds.’ These came from all parts of Palestine; <strong> from Galilee, </strong> where he preached, <strong> Decapolis </strong> (meaning ‘ten cities’), a district principally east of the Jordan; according to Ritter, settled by the veterans of Alexander the Great, <strong> Jerusalem, </strong> the capital, <strong> Judea, </strong> the southern part of Palestine, <strong> and from beyond the Jordan, </strong> here referring to the northern part of Perea, on the east of the Jordan, south of Decapolis. The compact style of the original requires the omission of ‘from’ (italicized in common version), except in the case of the locality last named, ‘from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan.’
