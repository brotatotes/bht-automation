Matthew 4:6. The devil takes the weapon with which he had been already overcome. He too, ‘can cite Scripture for his purpose.’ But the result proves that Satan was but a surface reader, or rather a wilful perverter of the Scriptures.
	 He shall give,  etc. From Psalms 91:11-12.
	 On their hands,  more literal.
	 Lest haply,  not ‘at any time.’ This promise to all God’s people seems specially applicable to ‘the Son of God.’ The words, ‘in all thy ways,’ are omitted here, but without altering the sense. The original is poetic. Satan uses it literally, tempting to a rash confidence, as in the first instance to distrust. It was also a temptation to avoid the appointed endurance, and by one striking exercise of power prove himself the Messiah.
