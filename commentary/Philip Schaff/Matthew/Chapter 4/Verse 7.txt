<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:7">Matthew 4:7</span>. <strong> Again it is written. </strong> Not ‘written again.’ In another place; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+6:16">Deuteronomy 6:16</span>. Our <strong> </strong> Lord corrects the misinterpretation of poetic Scripture by citing a plain statement of the law. The original has ‘ye,’ but Jesus answers: <strong> Thou shalt not tempt, </strong> turning it directly upon the tempter, for every tempting of God is caused by Satan.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The Lord thy God. </strong> By such rash confidence God would be tempted. The direct address involves another thought: that Satan in thus tempting Him was tempting the Lord his God. Religious fanaticism is a tempting of God.
