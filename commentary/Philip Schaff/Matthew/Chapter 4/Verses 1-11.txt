The threefold temptation by Satan; the threefold victory over Satan. He who came ‘to destroy the works of the devil,’ triumphs over him in personal conflict. This was the Messiah’s  trial and  probation, as His baptism had been His inauguration. The second Adam, like the first, was tempted. Contrasts between the temptations: paradise, wilderness; fall, victory; disobedience and death, obedience and life. The aim of Satan was to make of Jesus a pseudo-Messiah, abusing the Divine gifts for selfish ends by conforming to the carnal expectations of the Jews respecting the Messiah. The three temptations: ( 1 ) to doubt the Word of God; ( 2 ) to presume upon the Word of God; ( 3 ) to reject the Word of God; or successive appeals to appetite, pride, ambition. On the analogy between the three temptations and the three Jewish parties, and the three great Messianic offices, see Lange,  Matthew, p. 86 .  Different views of the temptation:  1 . An external history, Satan appearing in person. Objections: ‘It involves something supernatural.’ But this might be expected in such circumstances. ‘Verse 8 cannot be taken literally.’ It may be in a qualified sense. The personality of Satan is implied, but this is no argument against this explanation. On the whole this is the most natural view.
	 2 . An inner experience, a soul struggle with Satan. The detailed accounts, full of references to localities and actions, might be thus explained. But it is necessary to admit some external elements, and it is difficult to draw the line. Bengel, Lange, and others, combine explanations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ).
	 3 . A vision, like that of Peter (Acts 10:0), and of Paul (2 Corinthians 12:0). It is difficult to account for the purely historical form of the accounts on this theory.
	4 . A parable clothed in narrative form.
	5 . A myth or religious poem, true in idea, but false in fact.
	 The last two are incompatible with the historical character of the Gospels.
