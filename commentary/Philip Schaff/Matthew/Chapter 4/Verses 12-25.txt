CONTENTS AND CONNECTION. The appearance of Jesus as the light of the world amidst the darkness of the land of Galilee, in accordance with prophecy (Matthew 4:12-16). The record begins at the close of the ministry of John the Baptist, whose message is reannounced by Jesus (Matthew 4:17). He chooses four fishermen as his attendants (Matthew 4:18-22), goes through Galilee healing the sick and followed by great multitudes from all parts of the country (Matthew 4:23-25). Matthew, as well as Mark and Luke, begin their account of our Lord’s ministry at this point. A number of events recorded by John (John 1:19; John 4:54) certainly intervened; including the first Passover at Jerusalem. Some place the second Passover (John 5:1) before this section, which they record as the beginning of the second year of our Lord’s ministry (see Introd. pp. 18 , 19 ). The fourth Gospel concerns itself more with events in Jerusalem, the others with those in Galilee. This may arise from different sources of information or from difference in plan.
