<p>CONTENTS AND CONNECTION. The appearance of Jesus as the light of the world amidst the darkness of the land of Galilee, in accordance with prophecy (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:12-16">Matthew 4:12-16</span>). The record begins at the close of the ministry of John the Baptist, whose message is reannounced by Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:17">Matthew 4:17</span>). He chooses four fishermen as his attendants (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:18-22">Matthew 4:18-22</span>), goes through Galilee healing the sick and followed by great multitudes from all parts of the country (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:23-25">Matthew 4:23-25</span>). Matthew, as well as Mark and Luke, begin their account of our Lord’s ministry at this point. A number of events recorded by John (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19">John 1:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:54">John 4:54</span>) certainly intervened; including the first Passover at Jerusalem. Some place the second Passover (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:1">John 5:1</span>) before this section, which they record as the beginning of the second year of our Lord’s ministry (see Introd. pp. 18 , 19 ). The fourth Gospel concerns itself more with events in Jerusalem, the others with those in Galilee. This may arise from different sources of information or from difference in plan.</p>
