<p>SECOND TEMPTATION; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:5-7">Matthew 4:5-7</span>. Luke mentions this last. The order here is probably exact; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:5">Matthew 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:8">Matthew 4:8</span>, indicate an order of succession, which is not necessarily implied in Luke’s account. The closing verses in the two narratives confirm this view. Matthew says: ‘Then the devil leaveth him.’ Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:13">Luke 4:13</span>): ‘And when the devil had ended all the temptation.’</p>
