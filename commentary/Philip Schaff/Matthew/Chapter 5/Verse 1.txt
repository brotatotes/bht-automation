<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> He went up. </strong> Not to avoid them, but to gather from them a willing audience.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Into the mountain, </strong> the Horns of Hattin, according to tradition. Stanley: ‘It is the only height seen in this direction from the lake of Gennesareth. The plain on which it stands is easily accessible from the lake, and from that plain to the summit is but a few minutes’ walk. The platform at the top is evidently suitable for the collection of a multitude, and corresponds precisely to the “level place” to which He would “come down” as from one of its higher horns to address the people.’ This suits the requirements of the view that Matthew and Luke report the same discourse (see note, p. 54 ). The central situation would also permit the gathering there of multitudes from all quarters.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> When he had sat down, </strong> or <strong> was seated. </strong> The usual posture of an Oriental teacher, and the natural one for familiar instruction.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> His disciples came unto him. </strong> The Twelve had already been chosen (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:14">Mark 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:13-20">Luke 7:13-20</span>), but this was not an ordination discourse to them. It is too general, and they were not to be sent out at once. The ordination discourse is in chap. 10 ‘His disciples’ may include all who came to be taught, as distinguished from the ‘multitudes’ who had come to see the miracles of healing.</p>
