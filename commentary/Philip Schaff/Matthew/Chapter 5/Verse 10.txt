Matthew 5:10.  For righteousness’ sake. ‘ Righteousness  ’ includes all the preceding graces; but the peacemakers are especially persecuted; the effort to spread the gospel of peace provokes the hostility of men. Righteous living does the same, however men may be compelled to admit its excellence. The Jews would not expect persecution to befall the Messiah’s subjects. Yet  theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  The promise to the ‘poor in spirit’ also. The only difference grows out of the nature of the parties. The ‘persecuted’ are probably capable of receiving a higher blessing. One class is spoken of throughout; the list of rewards begins and ends with the kingdom of heaven, a phrase summing up all the blessings.
