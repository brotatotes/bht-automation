Matthew 5:11.  Blessed are ye.  The personal application; a prophecy also, since  when men shall revile you,  etc., implies that this will happen. The first revilers and persecutors were the unbelieving Jews, here referred to indefinitely.
	 Revile,   i.e., reproach you to your face.
	 Persecute  refers to acts and the last phrase to backbiting.
	 Falsely,  literally, ‘lying’(agreeing with ‘men’). The word is omitted by some authorities; but in any case it is implied.
	 For my sake.  This shows that all the preceding beatitudes describe Christ’s disciples, that He is embodied Righteousness. Those only suffer for righteousness’ sake, who suffer for Christ’s sake; elsewhere we learn more distinctly; those only are blessed with righteousness who are blessed for Christ’s sake. The promised trouble for Christ’s sake comes as a part of the promised blessing for Christ’s sake.
