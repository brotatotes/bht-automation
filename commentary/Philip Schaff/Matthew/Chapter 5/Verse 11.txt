<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:11">Matthew 5:11</span>. <strong> Blessed are ye. </strong> The personal application; a prophecy also, since <strong> when men shall revile you, </strong> etc., implies that this will happen. The first revilers and persecutors were the unbelieving Jews, here referred to indefinitely.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Revile, </strong> <em> i.e.</em>, reproach you to your face.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Persecute </strong> refers to acts and the last phrase to backbiting.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> For my sake. </strong> This shows that all the preceding beatitudes describe Christ’s disciples, that He is embodied Righteousness. Those only suffer for righteousness’ sake, who suffer for Christ’s sake; elsewhere we learn more distinctly; those only are blessed with righteousness who are blessed for Christ’s sake. The promised trouble for Christ’s sake comes as a part of the promised blessing for Christ’s sake.</p>
