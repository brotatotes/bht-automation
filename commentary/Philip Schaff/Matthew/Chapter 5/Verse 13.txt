Matthew 5:13.  Ye,   i.e., the disciples, though not yet forming a distinct organization. The influence here spoken of depends not upon external organizations, but upon the power of Christ in the individual believers.
	 The salt of the earth.  Salt preserves, Christ’s disciples preserve the world from utter corruption. Salt seasons food and prevents insipidity; Christians are to give a spiritual seasoning to what is made ‘stale, flat, and unprofitable’ by ‘earthly’ minds; comp. Colossians 4:6. The first thought is the prominent one. ‘The earth’ refers to society as it exists.
	 But.  A warning against pride.
	 If the salt have lost its savour.  A mere supposition, yet salt in the East does lose its saltness by exposure, or foreign admixture rendering it impure, and is then ‘good for nothing,’ except to destroy fertility. Dr. Thomson (  The Land And The Book, vol. ii., pp. 43 , 44 ) mentions an instance coming under his own observation. Pure salt cannot lose its savor. The doctrinal bearings of the figure need not be pressed.
	 Of men.  No special emphasis seems to rest upon this phrase. The early date of the sermon forbids an exclusive reference of the verse to excommunication or deposition from the ministerial office.
