Matthew 5:14.  The light of the world.  The influence of salt is internal, of light, external; hence ‘earth’ (Matthew 5:13), and here ‘world,’ both referring to society or mankind, the latter more to its organized external form. Light is opposed to darkness, and dispels it; is the symbol of truth and holiness. Christ’s disciples opposed to the world, and yet to transform it, by driving away its ignorance and sin. They become the light of the world, because He is ‘the true light,’ and makes them partakers of His light.
	 A city set on a hill.  In the East, cities are often built on hills. Such a city may have been in sight, as later travellers think; but in any case, the figure is striking. The Church of God is such a city, and  must be seen, like the light.
