<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:14">Matthew 5:14</span>. <strong> The light of the world. </strong> The influence of salt is internal, of light, external; hence ‘earth’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:13">Matthew 5:13</span>), and here ‘world,’ both referring to society or mankind, the latter more to its organized external form. Light is opposed to darkness, and dispels it; is the symbol of truth and holiness. Christ’s disciples opposed to the world, and yet to transform it, by driving away its ignorance and sin. They become the light of the world, because He is ‘the true light,’ and makes them partakers of His light.
