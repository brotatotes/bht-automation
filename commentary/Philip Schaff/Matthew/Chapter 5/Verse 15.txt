Matthew 5:15.  A candle,  or ‘lamp.’
	 The bushel.  The ordinary household measure, holding about a peck. Under this the light could be hid.
	 But on the candlestick,  or ‘lampstand;’ its proper place, an elevated holder or stand, so that its light might be diffused as widely as possible.
	 It shineth.  ‘Giveth light,’ implies that a certain effect is necessarily produced, but the lamp only shines, its light may be rejected.
