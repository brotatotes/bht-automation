<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:15">Matthew 5:15</span>. <strong> A candle, </strong> or ‘lamp.’
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The bushel. </strong> The ordinary household measure, holding about a peck. Under this the light could be hid.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> But on the candlestick, </strong> or ‘lampstand;’ its proper place, an elevated holder or stand, so that its light might be diffused as widely as possible.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> It shineth. </strong> ‘Giveth light,’ implies that a certain effect is necessarily produced, but the lamp only shines, its light may be rejected.</p>
