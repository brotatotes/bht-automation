<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:17">Matthew 5:17</span>. <strong> Think not. </strong> See above. The great Teacher addresses Himself to the thoughts of the audience before Him.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> I came. </strong> This implies that He had a special mission; not as yet a direct avowal that He was the Messiah.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> To destroy, </strong> to undo, or do away with. Christ’s mission not negative and destructive, but positive and constructive; Christianity is neither revolution nor restoration, but a new creation, which, however, conserves and perfects all that is good in the old.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The law or the prophets. </strong> The whole spiritual development of the Old Testament is meant. This Christ came <strong> to fulfil, </strong> to make perfect as doctrine and to exhibit perfectly in life. So that we need not limit ‘law’ to the ceremonial law, or ‘prophets’ to the Messianic predictions. Christ fulfils the law: ( 1 ) theoretically, by unfolding its deep spiritual significance, as in this sermon; ( 2 ) practically, in his holy life, a perfect pattern for imitation; ( 3 ) by realizing the types and shadows of the ceremonial law; ( 4 ) by redeeming us through His expiatory death from the penalty and curse of the broken law; ( 5 ) by enabling us, through His Holy Spirit, to fulfil the law in gratitude to Him and in living union with Him.</p>
