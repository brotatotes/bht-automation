<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:18">Matthew 5:18</span>. <strong> Verily, </strong> lit., ‘Amen,’ <strong> I say unto you. </strong> The Evangelist John generally repeats the first word. The whole phrase is used by Christ alone, the absolute, personal Truth.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Till heaven, </strong> etc. Paraphrase: ‘While heaven and earth last, one jot or one tittle shall not pass from the law without all these, declared, promised, or typified, being done.’ A strong assertion of the permanent character of the law.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Jot </strong> means the smallest letter of the (Hebrew) alphabet, while <strong> tittle</strong>, i.e., ‘little horns,’ refers to the small turns by which one letter was distinguished from another. A warning against contempt for the Old Testament, which leads at last to a denial of Christ. He has Himself fulfilled the ceremonial law; He teaches the true, higher, spiritual significance of the whole law.</p>
