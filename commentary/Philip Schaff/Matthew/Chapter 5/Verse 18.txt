Matthew 5:18.  Verily,  lit., ‘Amen,’  I say unto you.  The Evangelist John generally repeats the first word. The whole phrase is used by Christ alone, the absolute, personal Truth.
	 Till heaven,  etc. Paraphrase: ‘While heaven and earth last, one jot or one tittle shall not pass from the law without all these, declared, promised, or typified, being done.’ A strong assertion of the permanent character of the law.
	 Jot  means the smallest letter of the (Hebrew) alphabet, while  tittle, i.e., ‘little horns,’ refers to the small turns by which one letter was distinguished from another. A warning against contempt for the Old Testament, which leads at last to a denial of Christ. He has Himself fulfilled the ceremonial law; He teaches the true, higher, spiritual significance of the whole law.
