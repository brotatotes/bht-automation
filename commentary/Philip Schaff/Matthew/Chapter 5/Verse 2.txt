Matthew 5:2.  Opened his mouth.  A formula indicating indicating ‘a solemn and authoritative utterance;’ comp, references. He had before opened the mouths of others; the King Himself now becomes the Teacher. When the Lord opens his mouth,  we should open our ears and hearts.
	 Taught,  literally, ‘was teaching,’ implying either continued or habitual discourse. It is appropriate, whether this sermon was uttered on one occasion, or is a summary of our Lord’s teachings.
