Matthew 5:21.  Ye have heard,  when the law was read in public, etc.
	 It was said to  (not ‘by’)  them of old time,  ‘the ancients.’ As the passage is from the law, the indefinite phrase, ‘it was said,’ cannot be referred to a false teacher or author of tradition.
	 Thou shalt not kill.  From the Decalogue, the sixth commandment (Exodus 20:13), the first of the second table; the fifth belongs rather to the first table, containing duties to God.  Whosoever shall kill,  commit actual murder,  shall be in danger of the judgment,  i.e., subject to trial by an earthly court, probably the one in the place he lived. The interpretation of the scribes; correct, but not complete.
