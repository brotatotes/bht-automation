<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:21">Matthew 5:21</span>. <strong> Ye have heard, </strong> when the law was read in public, etc.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> It was said to </strong> (not ‘by’) <strong> them of old time, </strong> ‘the ancients.’ As the passage is from the law, the indefinite phrase, ‘it was said,’ cannot be referred to a false teacher or author of tradition.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Thou shalt not kill. </strong> From the Decalogue, the sixth commandment (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:13">Exodus 20:13</span>), the first of the second table; the fifth belongs rather to the first table, containing duties to God. </p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Whosoever shall kill, </strong> commit actual murder, <strong> shall be in danger of the judgment, </strong> i.e., subject to trial by an earthly court, probably the one in the place he lived. The interpretation of the scribes; correct, but not complete.</p>
