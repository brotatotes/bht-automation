<p><strong> Art offering thy gift at the altar, </strong> engaged in what was then the highest act of worship. Even the most sacred act should make room for reconciliation.
	</p>
<p><strong> And there rememberest. </strong> Proper worship makes us mindful of duty to others.
	</p>
<p><strong> Thy brother, </strong> one closely connected with thee.
	</p>
<p><strong> Hath aught against thee. </strong> The charge may be groundless, but still may give occasion to bad feeling on our part.

<p><strong> Leave there thy gift, </strong> etc. Better postpone even an acknowledged religious duty than the duty of reconciliation. The case is put in the strongest form.
	</p>
<p><strong> Go thy way, </strong> not to neglect the religious duty, but in order to <strong> first be reconciled. </strong> The two clauses must be closely connected.
	</p>
<p><strong> Then come and offer thy gift. </strong> The reconciliation does not make the worship unnecessary. Discharge of duty to men does not do away with duty to God. One truly reconciled to his brother is readiest to come to God in His appointed way.
