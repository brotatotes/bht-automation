Matthew 5:28.  Every one who,  not seeth, but voluntarily  looketh,  with a view  to lust after her.  Our Lord declares, not that such an one shall be condemned, but that in his  heart he has committed the sin. Adultery of the heart, and of the eye, desecrate the temple of the Holy Spirit; how much more adultery in deed.
	 A woman  may mean a ‘wife,’ but the widest sense is not inappropriate.
