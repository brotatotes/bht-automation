<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:28">Matthew 5:28</span>. <strong> Every one who, </strong> not seeth, but voluntarily <strong> looketh, </strong> with a view <strong> to lust after her. </strong> Our Lord declares, not that such an one shall be condemned, but that in his <em> heart</em> he has committed the sin. Adultery of the heart, and of the eye, desecrate the temple of the Holy Spirit; how much more adultery in deed.
