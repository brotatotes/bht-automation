<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> It was said also. </strong> ‘Hath been said’ (here and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:33">Matthew 5:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:38">Matthew 5:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:43">Matthew 5:43</span>), is an unnecessary variation. Quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+24:0">Deuteronomy 24:0</span>. Our Lord says elsewhere (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:8">Matthew 19:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:5">Mark 10:5</span>), that even this precept was owing to the hardness of their hearts.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The</strong> <strong> writing of divorcement, </strong> designed not to encourage divorce, but to render it more difficult, was in effect a protection of the repudiated wife. Our Lord’s explicit teaching opposed the perversion of this provision of the Mosaic law. Some of the Rabbins allowed divorce in a great variety of cases, one going so far as to make the discovery of a more pleasing woman a sufficient ground.</p>
