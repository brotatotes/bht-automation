Matthew 5:33. A summary of the Mosaic precepts in regard to swearing; negatively,  Thou shalt not swear falsely;   positively,  but shalt perform to the Lord thine oaths.  (Comp. Leviticus 19:12; Numbers 25:2.) The twofold mistake of the Jews, answered by our Lord: that only false swearing, and swearing by the name of God, were forbidden. They probably considered no oaths binding, save those in which the name of God occurred; this error, though not mentioned, is necessarily opposed.
