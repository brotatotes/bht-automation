Matthew 5:36.  By thy head.  No man can create a hair of his head, or even transform its color; what solemnity, then, in such an oath. Or, if carried further, to swear by what is under Godâ€™s control alone, is to swear by Him, and that in a very roundabout and senseless way. Dr. Thomson (  The Land And The Book) says the Orientals today are fearfully profane, swearing continually, by the heart, their life, the temple, or the church.
