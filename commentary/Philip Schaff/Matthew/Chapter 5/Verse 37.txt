<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:37">Matthew 5:37</span>. <strong> But let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay.</strong> <strong><em> </em></strong> Not only foolish oaths, like those cited, are forbidden, but also all unnecessary appealing to God. Even judicial appeals to God should not be multiplied. The true oath consists in the simple asseveration uttered under a sense of the presence of God, before Him, and in Him.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Cometh of evil,</strong> <strong><em> </em></strong> or ‘of the evil one.’ The meaning is the same in either case. All strengthening of simple yea and nay is occasioned by the presence of sin, and the power of Satan, in the world. There is no more striking proof of the existence of evil, than the prevalence of the foolish, low, useless habit of profanity. It could never have arisen, if men did not believe each other to be liars. Liars are most profane, and the reverse is true. Ignorance and stupidity increase the habit. Some men swear from want of ideas.</p>
