<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:38">Matthew 5:38</span>. <strong> Eye for an eye,</strong> <strong><em> </em></strong> etc. The law of retaliation (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:24">Exodus 21:24</span>) was a judicial rule, righteous in itself, and especially necessary in the East. Introduced to do away with the private revenge, so common in the time of Moses, it had been perverted into a warrant for retaliation of every kind. Our Lord teaches that while this rule is correct in law, our personal conduct should be governed by a very different principle.</p>
