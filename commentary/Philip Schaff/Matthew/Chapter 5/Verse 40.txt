<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:40">Matthew 5:40</span>. This verse may be thus rendered: ‘If any man desires to go to law with thee, and (by so doing) to take away thy coat (the inner garment, or tunic), let thy cloak (the more expensive upper garment) also go to him.’ The ‘cloak’ was frequently used as a covering at night, and according to the Mosaic law (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:26">Exodus 21:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:29">Exodus 21:29</span>) could not be retained as a pledge over night. Rather give up even what the law cannot seize than cherish a vindictive spirit. Christians ought not to be those ‘desiring to go to law.’ Such often harbor vengeance while they speak of justice.</p>
