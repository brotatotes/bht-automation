Matthew 5:42.  Give to him that asketh thee.   Begging was as common and annoying then as now.  And from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away,   or ‘be not turned away.’ Obviously to give to every beggar, to lend to ever) borrower, would be as hurtful to them as harassing and exhausting to us. Refusal may often be the best gift. Our gifts and loans are to be measured by the welfare, not by the desert of the asker; and to be made in the spirit of our Heavenly Father (Matthew 5:45).
