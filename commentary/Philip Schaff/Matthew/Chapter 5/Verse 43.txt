Matthew 5:43.  Thou shalt love thy neighbour.   (See Leviticus 19:18). The original precept referred to Israelites, and obedience to it helped to keep them distinct from other nations. But the Pharisees, to increase the distance between the Jews and Gentiles, added the converse precept:  and hate thine enemy,   meaning by ‘enemy’ the Gentiles (comp. Deuteronomy 23:6). Latin authors speak of this as a distinctive feature of the Jewish character. Personal hatred also was probably justified by this assumed meaning of the words of Moses. Our Lord (‘a light to lighten the Gentiles’) opposes this interpretation. Separatism was necessary to preserve the Jews from heathen influence, but this addition was contrary to prophecy and to the purpose of God in sending the Messiah. (Whom He meant by ‘neighbor,’ we learn from Luke 10:27 ff.)
