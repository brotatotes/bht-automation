Matthew 5:44.  Love your enemies.   The controlling principle, literally and universally applicable. One of the few precepts which admit of no distinction between ‘letter’ and ‘spirit’ The law of love, once deemed applicable only to those of the same nation, is now declared valid towards all men, even personal enemies. This gospel principle and Pharisaism cannot be reconciled; here chiefly our righteousness must exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees. By his very hatred our enemy becomes our neighbor; his hatred tempts to retaliation, leaving us no choice but to fall or else defend ourselves with the weapons of love,  i.e., to meet ‘persecution’ with ‘prayer.’ The briefer form of the verse, found in the best authorities, is the correct one. The parts we omit were probably inserted from Luke 6:27-28.
