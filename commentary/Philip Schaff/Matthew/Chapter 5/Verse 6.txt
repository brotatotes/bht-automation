Matthew 5:6.  Hunger and thirst after righteousness.  ‘  The righteousness,’  i.e., God’s; something without us, given to us, not merely imputed to us, though that is included, but made ours, part of our life, as food is assimilated. A still stronger representation of the sense of spiritual need, advancing to positive longing, for a blessing, known to be the one needed, namely, God’s approval conformity to the will of God. Those thus hungering are blessed,  for they shall be filled,  shall get in abundance what they want. A narrow view of this righteousness interferes with the full obtaining of it.
