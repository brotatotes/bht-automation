<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:6">Matthew 5:6</span>. <strong> Hunger and thirst after righteousness. </strong> ‘ <em> The</em> righteousness,’ <em> i.e.</em>, God’s; something without us, given to us, not merely imputed to us, though that is included, but made ours, part of our life, as food is assimilated. A still stronger representation of the sense of spiritual need, advancing to positive longing, for a blessing, known to be the one needed, namely, God’s approval conformity to the will of God. Those thus hungering are blessed, <strong> for they shall be filled, </strong> shall get in abundance what they want. A narrow view of this righteousness interferes with the full obtaining of it.</p>
