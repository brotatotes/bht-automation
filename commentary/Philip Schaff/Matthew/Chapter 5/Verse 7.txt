Matthew 5:7.  The merciful.  Meekness is a passive virtue, mercy an active one. ‘The  meek bear the injustice of the world, the  merciful bravely address themselves to the wants of the world.’ ‘Every degree of sympathy and mutual love and help’ is included. The spring of this grace is in God’s mercy, although it is ever rewarded with new mercy; according to the annexed promise:  for they shall obtain mercy.  First of all, God’s mercy; the merciful character is both the evidence and the measure of God’s mercy. Mercy from men is included. All these beatitudes have a subordinate temporal application, for God rules the world, despite its sin.
