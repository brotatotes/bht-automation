The former is here meant, <em> i.e.</em> <strong> ,</strong> a simplicity of heart, or ‘that steady direction of the soul toward the Divine life which excludes every other object from the homage of the heart’ More than sincerity, or chastity of feeling, or outward purity, such as the Levitical law demanded and the hearers might have deemed sufficient, or the moral purity which philosophers enjoin; it is inward purity derived from God (comp, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:9">1 John 3:9</span>). Hence the promise: <strong> they shall see God. </strong> Fulfilled even here. This vision of God begins when spiritual vision begins in the regenerate heart (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18">Ephesians 1:18</span>); it is perfected when in eternity we shall see Him face to face (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:12">1 Corinthians 13:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>), perfect knowledge being combined with perfect love.</p>
