The scene (Matthew 5:1), the formal preface of the Evangelist (Matthew 5:2); the opening description of the citizens of the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 5:3-10); their relation to the world (Matthew 5:11-16), in the form of a personal application. The discourse opens with a simplicity that would be abrupt, were it not so full of blessing. Only One bringing heaven’s blessedness to earth could thus speak.  The beatitudes  (so called from  beati, the word which begins these verses in the Latin version) are usually spoken of as seven in number, Matthew 5:10-11 being considered supplementary,  i.e., Matthew 5:10 sums up the preceding seven under the comprehensive term of  righteousness, and Matthew 5:11 applies the whole to the disciples. Describing one class of persons, they explain each other. Contrasts: Sinai and the Mount of Beatitudes; the law ends with blessing to those who keep it; Christ begins with blessings to those who through it have been brought to a sense of sin and guilt. The citizens of the kingdom, as the Jews expected them to be, and as Christ declared them to be (comp. on this contrast, the beatitudes and ‘woes’ of Luke’s account; chap. Matthew 6:20-26); those whom they regarded as blessed; and those whom He pronounced so; these beatitudes found in the Old Testament, but only in the light that Christ sheds upon it; the world’s judgment and Christ’s judgment as to qualities to be honored; the world had honored and deified courage, wisdom, and strength; Christ proclaims as divine, poverty of spirit contrition, meekness, moral longings, mercy, purity, peaceableness, and patient endurance. Men may adore intellect and power, praising the active virtues; but the distinctive virtues of the citizens of Christ’s kingdom are those passive ones He has shown to be divine.
