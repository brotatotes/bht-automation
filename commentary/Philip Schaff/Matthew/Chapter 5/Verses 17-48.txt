Our Lord defines His relation to the old dispensation (Matthew 5:17-19), thus introducing the negative leading thought, viz., the utter failure of the Pharisees to attain true righteousness, according to the law, which He came to fulfil (Matthew 5:20); an exposition of the requirements of the law (Matthew 5:21-47), culminating in the positive leading thought, our perfect heavenly Father the true standard of righteousness (Matthew 5:48). The occasion of this part of the discourse was, either the false notion that the Messiah would introduce a period of license (Matthew 5:17), or the antagonism between what He had just said and the teaching of the Pharisees. The former is simpler. Still the other is natural. A popular audience generally puts an extreme construction on new doctrines; as he seemed to oppose the strict legalists, they may have asked themselves, ‘Will He do away with the law.’ In any case the connection with what precedes is: Our Lord shows His disciples that they are to become lights of the world (Matthew 5:15-16), not as revolutionary radicals but as historical reformers. The law fulfilled by Christ, in Christ, through Christ. The law spiritualized, not abrogated. The gentle Teacher the most exacting; not externally but internally. The boldness (‘I say unto you’), breadth, depth, and height of this exposition. Like the introduction, it culminates in a reference to our heavenly Father.
