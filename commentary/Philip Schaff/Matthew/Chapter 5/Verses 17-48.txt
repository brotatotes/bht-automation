<p>Our Lord defines His relation to the old dispensation (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:17-19">Matthew 5:17-19</span>), thus introducing the negative leading thought, viz., the utter failure of the Pharisees to attain true righteousness, according to the law, which He came to fulfil (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:20">Matthew 5:20</span>); an exposition of the requirements of the law (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:21-47">Matthew 5:21-47</span>), culminating in the positive leading thought, our perfect heavenly Father the true standard of righteousness (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:48">Matthew 5:48</span>). The occasion of this part of the discourse was, either the false notion that the Messiah would introduce a period of license (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:17">Matthew 5:17</span>), or the antagonism between what He had just said and the teaching of the Pharisees. The former is simpler. Still the other is natural. A popular audience generally puts an extreme construction on new doctrines; as he seemed to oppose the strict legalists, they may have asked themselves, ‘Will He do away with the law.’ In any case the connection with what precedes is: Our Lord shows His disciples that they are to become lights of the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:15-16">Matthew 5:15-16</span>), not as revolutionary radicals but as historical reformers. The law fulfilled by Christ, in Christ, through Christ. The law spiritualized, not abrogated. The gentle Teacher the most exacting; not externally but internally. The boldness (‘I say unto you’), breadth, depth, and height of this exposition. Like the introduction, it culminates in a reference to our heavenly Father.</p>
