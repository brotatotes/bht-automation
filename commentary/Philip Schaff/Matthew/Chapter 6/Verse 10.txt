<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:10">Matthew 6:10</span>. <strong> Thy kingdom come </strong> ( <em> second petition). </em> The Messiah’s kingdom, which in organized form had not yet come, but was proclaimed by the Lord Himself, as at hand. It did speedily come, as opposed to the Old Testament theocracy; but in its fulness, including the triumph of Christ’s kingdom over the kingdom of darkness it has not yet come. For this coining we now pray and the prayer is answered, in part by every success of the gospel, and will be answered entirely when the King comes again. A missionary petition, but not less a prayer for our own higher sanctification and for the second coming of Christ

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Thy will be done as in heaven, so on earth </strong> ( <em> third petition).</em> <strong><em> </em></strong> ‘Heaven’ and ‘earth,’ put for their inhabitants. As by pure angels, so by men. The idea of human doing is prominent, our will subordinate to God’s will ‘As’ expresses similarity in kind and completeness.
