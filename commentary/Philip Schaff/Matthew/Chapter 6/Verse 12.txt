<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:12">Matthew 6:12</span>. <strong> And forgive us our debts, </strong> etc. ( <em> fifth petition). ‘</em> Debts,’ undoubtedly, moral obligations unfulfilled, <em> i.e., sins.</em> See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:14">Matthew 6:14</span>, which requires this sense.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> As we have forgiven. </strong> ‘As’ <em> i.e.</em>, ’in the same manner as;’ not, ‘to the same extent as,’ nor ‘because.’ The spirit of forgiveness, which God implants, gives a better assurance of His forgiveness. Our debtors, like ‘debts,’ is to be taken in the moral sense. We are sinners, always needing forgiveness; forgiveness and readiness to forgive cannot be separated, the latter being the evidence of the former.
