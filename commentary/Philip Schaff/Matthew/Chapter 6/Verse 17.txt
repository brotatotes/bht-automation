<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Anoint thy head and wash thy face.</strong> The usual practice before meals, especially before feasts. Special preparation would involve hypocrisy also. The meaning is, perform the cleansing usual and proper before meals even when fasting. (The maxim of sound piety, ‘cleanliness next to godliness.’ Hypocrisy and false asceticism reverse the maxim.)
