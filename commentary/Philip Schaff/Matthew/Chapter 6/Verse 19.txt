Matthew 6:19.  Lay not up for yourselves treasures,  literally, ‘treasure not for yourselves treasures.’
	 Upon the earth. This qualifies ‘Lay not up,’ rather than ‘treasures.’ Earthly treasures are not forbidden in themselves, but the earthly storing up, the earthly desire manifesting itself in the common striving after wealth. It is no sin to  be rich, but it is a sin to  love riches, which the poorest may do; while the rich man may glorify God and benefit man by his wealth.
	 Where moth and rust consume.  ‘Moth;’ in oriental countries, treasures of clothing were laid up. The Greek word translated ‘rust ‘means, literally, ‘eating,’ ‘consumption,’ referring here to the ‘wear and tear’ of time which consumes our possessions. ‘Consume’ is better than ‘corrupt.’
	 Thieves break through (lit, ‘dig through’)  and steal. The term, ‘thieves’ is quite general. Robbers in the East often break through the walls of mud or unburnt brick common in those regions. The verse exhibits in general the variety of all earthly treasures, which are earthly in their ‘place,’ their ‘kind,’ and ‘the manner of their collection.’ Not likely to be understood too literally.
