Matthew 6:2-4. FIRST EXAMPLE (  Almsgiving).
	 Matthew 6:2.  Therefore, in view of this general precept
	 Alms. A contraction or corruption of the Greek word used by the Evangelist
	 Do not sound a trumpet before thee,  etc. It would be impossible to blow a trumpet  in the synagogues,  where the alms were regularly collected, or even  in the streets, where the giver would be accosted by the beggar, and hardly carry a trumpet with him for such casual occurrences. The language is figurative: a trumpet was sounded before official personages to call attention to them; hence self-laudation and display are meant.
	 Hypocrites.  The Pharisees are not named, but, as a class, deserved this epithet.
	 They have received their reward;  already in full, and will get no more. They have the applause of men; the favor of God is denied by Matthew 6:1. Their ‘due’ reward is not spoken of.
