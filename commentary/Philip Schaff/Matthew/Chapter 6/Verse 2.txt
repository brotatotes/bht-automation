<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:2">Matthew 6:2</span>. <strong> Therefore,</strong> in view of this general precept
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Alms.</strong> A contraction or corruption of the Greek word used by the Evangelist
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Do not sound a trumpet before thee, </strong> etc. It would be impossible to blow a trumpet <strong> in the synagogues, </strong> where the alms were regularly collected, or even <strong> in the streets,</strong> where the giver would be accosted by the beggar, and hardly carry a trumpet with him for such casual occurrences. The language is figurative: a trumpet was sounded before official personages to call attention to them; hence self-laudation and display are meant.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Hypocrites. </strong> The Pharisees are not named, but, as a class, deserved this epithet.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> They have received their reward; </strong> already in full, and will get no more. They have the applause of men; the favor of God is denied by <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:1">Matthew 6:1</span>. Their ‘due’ reward is not spoken of.
