<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:20">Matthew 6:20</span>. A positive precept, answering exactly to the negative one of the last verse: <strong> but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven. </strong> ‘Heaven’ sometimes means the atmospheric heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:26">Matthew 6:26</span>), sometimes the starry heavens (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:12">Hebrews 11:12</span>); here it is used in the highest and spiritual sense of the unknown region where God has His throne and reveals His glory (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:9-10">Matthew 6:9-10</span>). This is the ‘place’ where the treasures are laid up; the ‘character’ of the treasures, is therefore, eternal; they are to be collected in a heavenly ‘manner.’ Hence the reference is not exclusively to a future locality; nor is there a thought of purchasing a future and heavenly reward by laying up a store of good works. The superiority of these treasures is more prominent than the way to lay them up.
