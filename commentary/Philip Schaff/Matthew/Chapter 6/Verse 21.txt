Matthew 6:21.  For. A reason for the preceding precepts (Matthew 6:19-20).
	 Where thy treasure is, whether on earth or in heaven,  there will thine heart be also. The singular pronoun adds impressiveness. Not a question of mere profit and loss, but of affection and of character. The precepts are for those who hope to become subjects of the kingdom of heaven. Such must have their heart in heaven, hence they must lay up their treasures there. The dedication of the heart to God is the underlying thought on which the particular teachings are based. May be used in support of the voluntary principle. People take more interest in the Church, if they sustain it by purse and personal effort.
