Matthew 6:22. Not an abrupt transition, but an illustration of the importance of dedicating the heart to God supremely.
	 The lamp (the same word used in chap. Matthew 5:15, but different from that’ rendered ‘light’ at the close of this verse, and in Matthew 6:23)  of the body is the eye.  The eye gives light which it receives from without, and is not light itself, so the conscience lights the spirit by light from above. Single,  i.e., presenting a single, clear image. The application is to single apprehension of God as the supreme object of trust and love.
	 Full of light,  or, ‘in light,’ ‘in full light,’ the body having received what the eye was designed to convey.
