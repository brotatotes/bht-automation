<p><strong> The lamp</strong> (the same word used in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:15">Matthew 5:15</span>, but different from that’ rendered ‘light’ at the close of this verse, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:23">Matthew 6:23</span>) <strong> of the body is the eye. </strong> The eye gives light which it receives from without, and is not light itself, so the conscience lights the spirit by light from above. Single, <em> i.e.,</em> presenting a single, clear image. The application is to single apprehension of God as the supreme object of trust and love.
	</p>
<p><strong> Full of light, </strong> or, ‘in light,’ ‘in full light,’ the body having received what the eye was designed to convey.
