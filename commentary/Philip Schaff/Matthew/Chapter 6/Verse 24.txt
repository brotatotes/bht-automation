Matthew 6:24. A still plainer illustration, to prove that man cannot be thus divided, must be  one,  light or dark, servant of God or of Mammon. Serve,  i.e., be the slave of, yielding entire obedience. A hired servant might faithfully serve two masters, but such service is not meant here.
	 For either he will hate the one, etc. Explanations: ( 1 ) The suppositions the reverse of each other, with no particular difference between the two sets of verbs: ‘He will either hate A and love B, or cleave to A and despise B.’ ( 2 ) The second clause less strong than the first, the reference being to the proper master and a usurper; the servant may hate the proper master, and love the usurper, or if he love the former cleave to him, and despise the latter. The proper master (God) may be loved or hated, but cannot be despised. Hence in any case ‘one’ in the latter clause must be God.
	 Ye cannot serve God and mammon.  This is the direct application. ‘Money in opposition to God is personified and regarded as an idol, somewhat like Plutus, although it cannot be shown that such an idol was worshipped’ (Olshausen). The Chaldee word ‘mammon’ originally meant ‘trust’ or confidence, and riches are the trust of worldly men. If God be not the object of supreme trust, something else will be, and it is most likely to be money. We must choose. Not the possession of money, but its mastery over the mind, is condemned.
