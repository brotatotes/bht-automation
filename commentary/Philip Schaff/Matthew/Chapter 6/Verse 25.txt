<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:25">Matthew 6:25</span>. <strong> Therefore. </strong> Because of the precept just given. Anxiety, which is distrust of God, is the source of avarice. Living to God is the proper life, and it relieves from care, because we trust Him for what we need. This thought is expanded in the remainder of the chapter.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Be not anxious. </strong> The word means: ‘to be distracted,’ ‘to have the mind drawn two ways.’ Ordinary thought or care is not forbidden (comp. 1Ti 5:8 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:8">1 Timothy 5:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:10">2 Thessalonians 3:10</span>), yet there is little danger of its being understood too literally. When thought about temporal things becomes anxiety, it has become distrust of God.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Your life. </strong> The word here used means ‘soul’ as the seat of physical life. Hence the needs of this life are spoken of, <strong> what ye shall eat,</strong> etc. The body too has the same needs, but clothing is more properly connected with it here: <strong> what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than the meat? </strong> ‘ <em> The</em> meat,’ (i.e. <em> ,</em> food of all kinds), needed to sustain it. Is not He who gave ‘the life’ able and willing to give what will sustain it, and He who made ‘the body,’ what will protect it.
