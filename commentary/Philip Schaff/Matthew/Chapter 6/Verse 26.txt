<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The birds of the heaven,</strong> the sky, the atmospheric heaven. This expresses the wild freedom above the earth which contains their food, and also their lower rank in the scale of creation.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> That.</strong> Not ‘for.’ We are to behold with respect to the birds this fact, that <strong> they sow not,</strong> etc. Do not use the means which we all ought to use.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Barns, </strong> any kind of storehouse.
