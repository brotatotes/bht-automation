Matthew 6:27.  Add one cubit unto his age, prolong his life in the least ‘Age’ is preferable to ‘stature’ (the word has both meanings); the reference is not to the body but to the life; further, to add a cubit ( 18 inches) to the stature would be a very great thing. Our age is conceived of as a race or journey. If then we cannot do what is least by our care, why be anxious?
