<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:28">Matthew 6:28</span>. <strong> For raiment.</strong> The second thought in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:25">Matthew 6:25</span> is now expanded and illustrated; not only anxiety, but the common and childish vanity about raiment, is reproved.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The lilies of the field,</strong> <em> i.e.,</em> wild lilies, growing without human care. The words, ‘grass of the field’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:30">Matthew 6:30</span>) lead us to suppose that wild flowers in general are meant. Many, however, because of the reference to the pomp of Solomon, suppose the Huleh lily is specially referred to: ‘it is very large, and the three inner petals meet above, and form a gorgeous canopy, such as art never approached, and king never sat under, even in his utmost glory’ (Thomson, <em> The Land and the Book),</em> This flower was common in the neighborhood of Nazareth.
