Matthew 6:32.  But seek ye first. No ‘secondly’ is implied, as though we might be avaricious, after we have attended to the duties of religion. The first object is supreme. This positive command is needed, for we can avoid such anxious thought, only when we have some better object
	 His kingdom,  i.e., ‘your heavenly Father’s’ (Matthew 6:32). The common reading is an alteration for explanation. Supreme dedication to a Personal Object of trust and desire, who is our Father for Christ’s sake, is here commanded.
	 His righteousness.  The spiritual purity spoken of throughout. Not ‘justification,’ which this word does not mean, however true it is that we obtain God’s righteousness through ‘justification.’ This verse, which contains the crowning thought of this chapter, echoes the crowning thought of the whole discourse (chap. Matthew 5:48).
	 All these things,  these things needed for the body.
	 Shall be added to you,  over and above the spiritual blessings, which result from seeking God as the supreme object. We are to ask God for temporal things. Christian prayer implies intimate and constant approach to God, which would be impossible if we could not tell Him of all our real needs. To ask for them unconditionally, or to allow them to crowd out spiritual desires and affections, is certainly forbidden.
