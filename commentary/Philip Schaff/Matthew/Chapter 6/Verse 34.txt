Matthew 6:34.  Therefore. Either: a further deduction; or a summing up. The first view accords better with the reason given and would presuppose the other lessons; the latter is favored by the position of the verse immediately after the general precept of Matthew 6:33, and finds a place more easily in a logical analysis of the discourse. It is suspicious for that reason.
	 The morrow  is here personified.
	 For the morrow will be anxious for itself. Not ‘take care of itself,’ but ‘bring its own cares and anxieties,’ do not foolishly increase those of today by borrowing from the morrow.
	 Sufficient unto the day,  or for the day,  is the evil thereof. ‘Evil’ may mean natural or moral evil, suffering, or sin. The latter sense is the more usual one, the former suits the context better. Perhaps both may be included, the sin being the want of trust under the suffering. A hint that we never fully obey the precepts just uttered, because our dedication to God is so imperfect.
