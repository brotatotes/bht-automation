<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:6">Matthew 6:6</span>. Shows the proper way, and the injunction is made more personal: <strong> Thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet.</strong> The little room on the housetop of an Eastern dwelling, used for such purposes. ‘Thy’ implies that the place is one where the person can secure privacy.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Shut thy door. </strong> This extends the idea of privacy and solitude. Private prayer, which is exclusively referred to here, is not to be performed in public places. The ‘closet’ may be sought and the door shut in a Pharisaical spirit; but this command is to be obeyed; if possible, literally, since our Lord’s example teaches the importance of retirement. Actual solitude may be impossible, but even in the midst of a crowd we may be alone with God. How often the duty of secret prayer should be statedly performed is of course not mentioned. A prayerful spirit will multiply both opportunities and desires for the exercise; while prudence, not law, calls for stated times.
