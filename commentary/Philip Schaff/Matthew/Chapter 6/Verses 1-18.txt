<p>Our Lord passes from moral to religious duties, enjoining a ‘righteousness’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:1">Matthew 6:1</span>), which exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees (‘hypocrites’), and has regard to the character of our ‘Father who is in heaven.’ The three leading manifestations of practical piety: <strong> </strong> <em> almsgiving</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:2-4">Matthew 6:2-4</span>), <em> prayer</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:5-15">Matthew 6:5-15</span>), and <em> fasting</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:17-18">Matthew 6:17-18</span>), as performed by hypocrites and by the subjects of Christ’s kingdom. The wrong end: ‘to be seen of men;’ the wrong method, ‘before men;’ the wrong reward, ‘they have received’ it. The right end, ‘to glorify our heavenly Father’ (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:16">Matthew 5:16</span>); the right method, ‘in secret;’ the right reward, that which our heavenly Father shall give. The false tendency leads to externalism, publicity, and present popularity in religion. The true public worship of God must encourage the meekness and humility of individual worshippers. Forgiveness and worship again conjoined (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:12">Matthew 6:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:14-15">Matthew 6:14-15</span>, comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:23-24">Matthew 5:23-24</span>). The close connection of self-righteous worship with merely outward worship, and the rapid transition to vain and sinful worship. On the Lord’s Prayer, see below.
