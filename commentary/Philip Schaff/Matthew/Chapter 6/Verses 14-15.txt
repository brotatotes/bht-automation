<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:14-15">Matthew 6:14-15</span>. These verses explain the fifth petition (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:12">Matthew 6:12</span>), substituting the word ‘trespass’ for ‘debt,’ as some liturgies do in the Lord’s Prayer itself. In ‘debt’ the notion of obligation is prominent, in ‘trespass’ that of misstep, falling away from what is right. The adoption of this explanation shows that forgiveness and readiness to forgive were among the leading ideas of the prayer. They are <em> distinctively Christian</em> ideas. The people were not prepared to learn the true <em> ground</em> of forgiveness, the redeeming work of Christ, but the principle could be laid down. No man is forgiven of God (whatever be his understanding of the doctrine of justification by faith, his theoretical belief about the Person of Christ, and the work of the Holy Spirit) who has not received with the forgiveness of his own sins the spirit of forgiveness toward others. It is impossible that we should be forgiven, because we forgive others, for none can do this until forgiven of God for Christ’s sake. Because He is our forgiving ‘Father,’ He will not brook an unforgiving spirit in us.
