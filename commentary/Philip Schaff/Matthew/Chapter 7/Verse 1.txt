<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:1">Matthew 7:1</span>. <strong> Judge not.</strong> This refers to harsh, unkind judgment, not to the mere formation of private opinion, or to judicial sentences.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> That ye be not judged, </strong> not by other men, but by God. His judgment is more strict, and it takes special account of this harsh censorious spirit. The judgment of men often corresponds.
