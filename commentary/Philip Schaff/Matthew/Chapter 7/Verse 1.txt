Matthew 7:1.  Judge not. This refers to harsh, unkind judgment, not to the mere formation of private opinion, or to judicial sentences.
	 That ye be not judged,  not by other men, but by God. His judgment is more strict, and it takes special account of this harsh censorious spirit. The judgment of men often corresponds.
