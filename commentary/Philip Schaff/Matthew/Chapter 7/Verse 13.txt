Matthew 7:13.  Enter ye in by, or through, the narrow gate.  The ‘gate’ is mentioned first; the way afterwards. It is the entrance gate at the beginning of the journey of life (the way), not the gate of heaven at the close. Bunyan’s ‘Pilgrim’s Progress’ is the best commentary on all such figures. Explanations: Repentance, faith, humility, self-denial, poverty in spirit (Matthew 7:3), the righteousness of Christ; the last is probably the best sense, in contrast with the self-righteousness of the Pharisees (the wide gate).
	 For wide is the gate and broad the way,  etc. More attractive, more easy to find, and to follow. A reason (‘for’) why we must be exhorted to enter in by the narrow gate. To follow our natural tendencies is to pursue the broad way.
	 Destruction.  The way leads to this; in one sense it is this already. Carnal Judaism led to the destruction of Jerusalem. Carnal Christianity passes on to similar judgment.
