<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:14">Matthew 7:14</span>. <strong> Straitened</strong> (lit, ‘pressed together’) <strong> is the way.</strong> Even after we pass through the gate the Christian course continues difficult, is a constant conflict and self-denial, but it <strong> leadeth unto life.</strong> Eternal life which begins in this world, but is obtained in its fulness in eternity. The way to destruction is broad ‘because’ it is used by so many.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Few are they that find the straitened way.</strong> It is not even discovered by most, much less entered upon. This not because God has made it so ‘strait,’ but because so few desire to find it.
