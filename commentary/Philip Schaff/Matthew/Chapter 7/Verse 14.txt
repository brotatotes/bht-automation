Matthew 7:14.  Straitened (lit, ‘pressed together’)  is the way. Even after we pass through the gate the Christian course continues difficult, is a constant conflict and self-denial, but it  leadeth unto life. Eternal life which begins in this world, but is obtained in its fulness in eternity. The way to destruction is broad ‘because’ it is used by so many.
	 Few are they that find the straitened way. It is not even discovered by most, much less entered upon. This not because God has made it so ‘strait,’ but because so few desire to find it.
