<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:15">Matthew 7:15</span>. <strong> Beware of false prophets, </strong> <em> i.e.</em>., teachers. Not only is the way straitened, but those who might leave the ‘many’ to find it are in danger from false teachers, such as would prevent them from finding it. The warning may refer to the false teachers shortly to arise from among the Jews, but applies to all.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> That come to you. </strong> ‘False prophets’ are defined as those who do thus. They come ‘to you,’ to the professed disciples of Christ; more anxious to proselyte and pervert in the Church than to convert in the world, more meddlesome than missionary in their activity.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> In sheep’s clothing. </strong> No allusion to the dress of the prophets, but referring to the harmless exterior, or to the external connection with God’s flock
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Inwardly, </strong> or from within, acting according to their impulses, <strong> they are ravening wolves. </strong> The old destructive malice remains. The application of this strong (but not harsh) language to persons must be governed by what follows.
