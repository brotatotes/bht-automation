<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:17">Matthew 7:17</span>. The general law of nature is here laid down positively: As the tree, so is the fruit. The principle holds good in the moral world.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:18">Matthew 7:18</span> repeats the same truth, asserting the impossibility of its being otherwise. But while <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:16">Matthew 7:16</span> refers to kinds of plants, these verses speak of individual trees.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Every good tree,</strong> <em> i.e., </em> of a good nature for bearing fruit.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Good</strong> <strong> fruit</strong>, of a good kind.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The corrupt tree, </strong> literally, ‘spoiled,’ but meaning here of a bad quality; <strong> evil fruit, </strong> of a bad kind like the tree. Our Lord applies the general law to men’s actions and their moral results; these are but manifestations of a moral nature, depraved or sanctified.
