Matthew 7:17. The general law of nature is here laid down positively: As the tree, so is the fruit. The principle holds good in the moral world.
	 Matthew 7:18 repeats the same truth, asserting the impossibility of its being otherwise. But while Matthew 7:16 refers to kinds of plants, these verses speak of individual trees.
	 Every good tree,  i.e.,  of a good nature for bearing fruit.
	 Good  fruit, of a good kind.
	 The corrupt tree,  literally, ‘spoiled,’ but meaning here of a bad quality;  evil fruit,  of a bad kind like the tree. Our Lord applies the general law to men’s actions and their moral results; these are but manifestations of a moral nature, depraved or sanctified.
