Matthew 7:20.  Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.  Resumption of the thought of Matthew 7:16, which has been further illustrated. ‘Fruits,’ If in this case not ‘actions,’ as usually, the actions of the false teachers were decisive as to their character, there would be little danger of their deceiving others; ‘acts seemingly virtuous are often nothing more than the sheep’s clothing in which the wolf wraps himself in order that he may deceive and devour the sheep.’ (Wordsworth.) Their influence, the moral effect of their teaching, is meant. Their acts may be included, and also the influence exerted upon the doctrinal belief of others; not their own doctrines, however, which form the tree in a certain sense. The main test in the case of teachers is their influence upon the lives of others.
