Matthew 7:21. A natural transition from false teachers to false profession and self-deception.
	 Not every one.  The really pious profess Christ, but not all who profess are really pious. This answers a common objection urged against public profession from the number of hypocrites.
	 Lord,  Lord, the repetition is emphatic. This word, probably already used by the disciples, is the germ of a Christian confession, centering in the acknowledgment of personal allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ. Such acknowledgment in word (or subscription to an orthodox creed) is not enough for entrance into the kingdom of heaven.
	 But he that doeth, etc. Of all who thus confess, only those doing the will of God shall enter into the Kingdom of heaven. The contrast is not between hypocritical professors and holy non-professors, but between hypocrites and saints, all making the same outward profession.
	 My Father.  The whole Gospel shows that this means a closer relation than that expressed by the phrases, ‘your Father,’ ‘our Father.’ Christ, the only begotten Son, always addresses God as ‘Father,’ or ‘my Father.’
