<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:25">Matthew 7:25</span>. A picture of the sudden violent storms so common in the East, as indeed the definite articles indicate. No distinct meaning need be assigned to <strong> rain, floods,</strong> and <strong> winds, </strong> but <strong> the rock </strong> means Christ. The definite article points to this, and the figure is thus applied so frequently in the Scriptures. How we can build upon Christ, so that our doing of His sayings rests upon union with Him, is clearly made known elsewhere.
