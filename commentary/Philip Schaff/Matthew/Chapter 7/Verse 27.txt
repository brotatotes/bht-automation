<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:27">Matthew 7:27</span>. The description of a storm is repeated, but the result is different; the winds <strong> smote upon that house; and it fell.</strong> Instead of adding, ‘for it had been founded on the sand,’ our Lord closes the illustration, and at the same time the discourse, which began with the word, ‘blessed,’ by saying, <strong> and great was the fall of it.</strong> He emphasizes the completeness of the ruin. Admiration of the Sermon on the Mount, without obedience of its precepts, involves destruction, inevitable and utter. In order to do ‘these sayings,’ we must follow Christ further.
