Matthew 7:29.  For he taught them.  This may refer to His habitual mode of teaching.
	 As having authority. ‘One’ is not only unnecessary, but incorrect Christ is not ‘one’ among others ‘having authority,’ but the only one having authority, in this highest sense, as the one coming directly from God, and Himself the personal embodiment of the Truth.
	 And not as their scribes.  The scribes were expounders of the Old Testament. Their exposition, too, was in one sense authoritative, but they referred continually to the authority of learned Rabbins. Our Lord introduced His expositions thus: ‘Verily I say unto you.’ No Old Testament prophet assumed such authority, no mere man has a right to do so. He who uttered this matchless discourse on morals, has personal authority to tell men what is true, to declare what is right, to set up His judgment here and hereafter as the final appeal. None but the God-Man could be the teacher on the Mount of Beatitudes.
