<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:5">Matthew 7:5</span>. <strong> Thou hypocrite. </strong> Not necessarily the Pharisees, but any who thus act. Such action is hypocrisy before God and before the conscience also. First, before meddling with others.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> And then shalt thou see clearly.</strong> ‘See’ differs from ‘behold’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:3">Matthew 7:3</span>). The look must be purified before it can be used for this end; one must have got rid of great faults before he can see ‘clearly’ enough to help his brother get rid of his faults. To get clearness of vision ourselves is the great end; caution is necessary in helping the brother.
