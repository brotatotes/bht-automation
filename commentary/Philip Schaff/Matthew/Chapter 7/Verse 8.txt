Matthew 7:8.  For every one that asketh, etc. An invariable rule; a plain promise, not for the future, but for the present, since our Lord says:  receiveth, findeth, it is opened.  This promise, several times repeated by our Lord, is limited only by the verses which follow; comp., however, James 4:3, ‘Ye ask and receive not; because ye ask amiss.’ God always answers the right kind of prayer, but in His own right way.
