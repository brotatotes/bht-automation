CONNECTION and CONTENTS. The connection is not obvious; no theory can be insisted upon. Various views: ( 1 ) No connection intended. ( 2 ) Matthew 7:7 is connected with the last chapter, while Matthew 7:1-5 were addressed directly to the Pharisees (who were showing signs of dissent), Matthew 7:6 to the disciples in regard to the Pharisees. Conjectural. ( 3 ) A contrast (so Lange): Be not surcharged with worldly cares for the morrow, but rather be filled with spiritual anxiety for the day of judgment. Not obvious, since Matthew 7:2; Matthew 7:12 are closely related to each other in thought ( 4 ) Matthew 7:1-12, grouped as a whole, referring to conduct toward our fellow men. The former part may have been addressed to the opposers; but the connection of thought is not to be broken by joining Matthew 7:7 directly with the last chapter. This we prefer. The line of thought, then, is: In this evil world (Matthew 6:34) where there is so much to provoke censoriousness, do not indulge in it, since it exposes you to judgment (Matthew 7:1-2); the folly and hypocrisy of it is shown by an illustration (Matthew 7:3-5); the extreme of laxity is quite as foolish (Matthew 7:6); remember, however, Godâ€™s kind and wise dealings (Matthew 7:7-11), and act thus kindly and wisely to others (Matthew 7:12), without censoriousness on the one hand, or casting pearls before swine on the other.
