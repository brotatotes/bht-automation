<p>CONNECTION and CONTENTS. The connection is not obvious; no theory can be insisted upon. Various views: ( 1 ) No connection intended. ( 2 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:7">Matthew 7:7</span> is connected with the last chapter, while <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:1-5">Matthew 7:1-5</span> were addressed directly to the Pharisees (who were showing signs of dissent), <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:6">Matthew 7:6</span> to the disciples in regard to the Pharisees. Conjectural. ( 3 ) A contrast (so Lange): Be not surcharged with worldly cares for the morrow, but rather be filled with spiritual anxiety for the day of judgment. Not obvious, since <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:2">Matthew 7:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:12">Matthew 7:12</span> are closely related to each other in thought ( 4 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:1-12">Matthew 7:1-12</span>, grouped as a whole, referring to conduct toward our fellow men. The former part may have been addressed to the opposers; but the connection of thought is not to be broken by joining <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:7">Matthew 7:7</span> directly with the last chapter. This we prefer. The line of thought, then, is: In this evil world (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:34">Matthew 6:34</span>) where there is so much to provoke censoriousness, do not indulge in it, since it exposes you to judgment (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:1-2">Matthew 7:1-2</span>); the folly and hypocrisy of it is shown by an illustration (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:3-5">Matthew 7:3-5</span>); the extreme of laxity is quite as foolish (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:6">Matthew 7:6</span>); remember, however, Godâ€™s kind and wise dealings (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:7-11">Matthew 7:7-11</span>), and act thus kindly and wisely to others (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:12">Matthew 7:12</span>), without censoriousness on the one hand, or casting pearls before swine on the other.
