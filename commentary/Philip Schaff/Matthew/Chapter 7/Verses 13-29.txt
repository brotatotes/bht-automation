<p>CONNECTION AND CONTENTS. The exposition of the requirements of ‘the law and the prophets’ just given, was far beyond the low morality of the scribes and Pharisees, and men might easily be tempted by their own hearts or by others to seek the easier way. Our Lord therefore concludes by urging His hearers to avoid the broad way and seek the narrow one marked out (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:13-14">Matthew 7:13-14</span>); warns them against hypocritical teachers (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:15-20">Matthew 7:15-20</span>), against self-deception (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:21-23">Matthew 7:21-23</span>), and closes with two similitudes respecting those who obey and disobey His precepts (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:24-27">Matthew 7:24-27</span>); <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:28-29">Matthew 7:28-29</span>, tell the impression produced by the discourse. Contrasts: the narrow and wide gates; the straitened and broad ways; the good and corrupt trees, with their fruit; saying and doing; active in Christ’s name, yet working iniquity; the rock and the sand; the standing the storm and falling in the storm; teaching with authority and teaching as their scribes.
