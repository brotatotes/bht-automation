<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:3">Matthew 7:3</span>. <strong> And, </strong> since the principle of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:2">Matthew 7:2</span> is correct, <strong> why beholdest thou?</strong> The verb means to observe, to voluntarily stare at; the context shows that the one addressed could not have clear vision; the question indicates that such observing was unnecessary. The singular ‘thou’ is pointed, too much so for a direct address to the Pharisees present

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The beam,</strong> a hyperbolical expression for a great fault, to show the relative magnitude. No reference to one class of sins. The ‘mote’ which might be overlooked is looked for, the ‘beam’ of which one must be conscious is not considered.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:4">Matthew 7:4</span>. <strong> Or how wilt thou say, </strong> have the face to say. A step in folly beyond that represented in the last verse.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Let me cast</strong> <strong> out</strong> (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:5">Matthew 7:5</span>); ‘permit me, I will cast out.’ The friendly language presents the censoriousness as hypocritical. True to nature! The epithet of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:5">Matthew 7:5</span> is not abruptly introduced.
