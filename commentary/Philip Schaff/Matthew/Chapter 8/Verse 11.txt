Matthew 8:11. Luke omits the further application contained in this and the following verse, recording them, however, when repeated on a different occasion (Luke 13:28-29).
	 That many shall come from the east and west. A prophecy that the Gentiles, even the most remote, shall enter the kingdom of heaven.
	 And shall sit down (i.e., ‘recline at table’)  with Abraham, etc. The Jews represented the delights of the Messiah’s kingdom as a feast with the patriarchs; but the reference here is rather to intimate domestic intercourse. The patriarchs are properly mentioned, since with these the separating of the people of God began.
