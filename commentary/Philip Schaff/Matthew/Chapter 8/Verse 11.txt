Luke omits the further application contained in this and the following verse, recording them, however, when repeated on a different occasion (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:28-29">Luke 13:28-29</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> That many shall come from the east and west.</strong> A prophecy that the Gentiles, even the most remote, shall enter the kingdom of heaven.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> And shall sit down</strong> (i.e., ‘recline at table’) <strong> with Abraham,</strong> etc. The Jews represented the delights of the Messiah’s kingdom as a feast with the patriarchs; but the reference here is rather to intimate domestic intercourse. The patriarchs are properly mentioned, since with these the separating of the people of God began.
