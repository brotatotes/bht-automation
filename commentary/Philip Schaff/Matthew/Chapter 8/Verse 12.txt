Matthew 8:12.  But the sons of the kingdom. The Jews, who, by hereditary right and according to the ordinary law of gracious influences, might be expected to enter, shall be cast out, expelled from the feast or home of their patriarchal ancestors,  into the outer darkness. The figure is that of darkness outside the house of feasting or the house of comfort.
	 There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, the sorrow and the rage consequent upon such expulsion. Also a hint at the wretchedness of a future state of punishment. The figures are fearful: black night, grief and rage.
