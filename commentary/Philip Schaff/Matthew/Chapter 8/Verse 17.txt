<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Isaiah the prophet. </strong> In the beautiful Messianic prediction, chap. 53 . The Evangelist does not quote from the common Greek version, but makes a more exact translation, varying from the original only in the substitution of diseases for ‘sorrows,’ in the last clause. This is allowable from the parallelism of ideas common to Hebrew poetry. The prophecy refers to bearing and expiating our sins, but is here applied to the healing of bodily diseases. His healing was also a suffering with and for us. These miracles were types of His great work of bearing the sins of the world, being directed against the effects of sin; they were signs and pledges of His spiritual power. His contact with all this suffering was an important part of the work of One who for us became ‘a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.’ Matthew’s application of the prophecy, especially at the close of such a group of miracles, is highly suggestive in regard to the vicarious work of our Lord. The work of healing is an integral part of our Lord’s redeeming work. The medical profession can find its highest incentive and truest glory in this fact.
