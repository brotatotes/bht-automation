<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Birds of the heaven have nests, </strong> more literally, <strong> </strong> ‘lodging places.’ The two represent the lower order of animals.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The Son of Man. </strong> A term applied to no one else, and often applied by our Lord to himself; used in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13">Daniel 7:13</span>, in reference to the Messiah seen in a vision. The prominent idea is that of the second Adam, but it also implies that Jesus was the Messiah. The thought here is of His real humanity, His capability of suffering and privation, in opposition to the carnal expectation of the Jews, shared no doubt by this scribe. The prophecy of Isaiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:17">Matthew 8:17</span>) seems to have led Matthew to introduce this similar thought in the midst of a series of miracles.

Immediately after we are told how He slept in the cabinless boat on the lake.

The conversation, according to Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:59">Luke 9:59</span>), began with the formal request of our Lord: ‘Follow me.’ This verse sounds like a response to such a command. Tradition says it was Philip; but our Lord had said, ‘Follow me’ to him first of all Apostles (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:43">John 1:43</span>). As wavering is implied, it may have been Thomas (Lange).

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Suffer me first to go away and bury my father.</strong> The father was already dead, and the disciple wanted to go home and attend to all the funeral ceremonies, intending to return and follow Christ.
