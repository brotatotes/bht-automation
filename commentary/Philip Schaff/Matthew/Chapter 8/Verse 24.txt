Matthew 8:24.  A great tempest in the sea.  The ‘storm of wind’ is mentioned by Mark and Luke. The word ‘tempest’ properly refers to the effect of the wind, being used also of an earthquake. This lake, like most inland seas, is subject to sudden and violent storms.
	 So that the boat was covered, lit, ‘was becoming covered’ with the waves. ‘Shipping seas’ in a boat without a deck would result, as Mark narrates, in the boat’s becoming full, and of course in the ‘jeopardy,’ of which Luke (Luke 8:23) speaks.
	 But he was asleep  or ‘sleeping,’ lying on the boat cushion in the stem (Mark). He who had not where to lay His head, could still sleep in the storm. Needing sleep, He slept; the result was a more striking exhibition of His power. (On the events of that busy day, see Mark 4:35.)
