<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:26">Matthew 8:26</span>. <strong> Why are ye fearful. </strong> ‘Afraid’ would be too weak, and ‘cowardly’ too strong.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> Of little faith.</strong> Fear while the Saviour was with them, evidence of ‘little faith;’ the cry to Him evidence they were not faithless. He rewards the faith they had, but rebukes them, because of their ‘little faith.’
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> He rebuked the winds and the sea, saying, </strong> ‘Peace, be still’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:39">Mark 4:39</span>).
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"> Matthew places the rebuke of the disciples first; Mark and Luke that of the elements.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> A great calm,</strong> a perfect stillness.
