Matthew 8:26.  Why are ye fearful.  ‘Afraid’ would be too weak, and ‘cowardly’ too strong.
	 Of little faith. Fear while the Saviour was with them, evidence of ‘little faith;’ the cry to Him evidence they were not faithless. He rewards the faith they had, but rebukes them, because of their ‘little faith.’
	 He rebuked the winds and the sea, saying,  ‘Peace, be still’ (Mark 4:39).
	 Matthew places the rebuke of the disciples first; Mark and Luke that of the elements.
	 A great calm, a perfect stillness.
