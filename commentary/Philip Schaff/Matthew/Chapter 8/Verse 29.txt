	 What have we to do with thee, lit ‘What (is) to us and thee,’ what have we in common? The language of the demons, who recognized Him as the son of God. ‘Jesus’ is omitted according to the best authorities.

It does not necessarily refer to some definite time of judgment or torment, when they would be forced to submit. The language is that of opposition, blended with consciousness of weakness. It is demoniacal to defy and oppose, even when conscious that it is useless! According to Luke, our Lord had already begun to exercise His power, and they knew they must obey.
