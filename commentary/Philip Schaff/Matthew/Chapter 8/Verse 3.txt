Matthew 8:3.  And he (the best authorities omit ‘Jesus’)  stretched forth his hand and touched him. Such touch was forbidden. Despite the consequent healing, it may have been regarded by the Pharisees as rendering Jesus unclean.
	 I will; be thou made clean, in direct correspondence with the leper’s expression of faith.
	 And straightway his leprosy was cleansed. The touch of a leper defiled, carried contagion, but the touch of our Lord overcame the defilement and contagion, removing the disease. Our Lord’s act in this case, as in most of His miracles, stands in a certain outward relation to the effect produced. The obvious lesson is: Go to Christ in faith for healing from spiritual leprosy.
