Matthew 8:32.  Go. Their request was fulfilled, and  they went away into the swine.  The fact of the possession of the swine is stated. It is not more improbable than that the human body could be under demoniacal control. The animal soul has desires and appetites which could be influenced by the demons.
	 Behold.  An evidence of the reality of the possession.
	 The whole herd, etc. The simultaneous rush of the whole herd was not a natural movement, but due to the possessed, since few gregarious animals are so marked by individual stubbornness as swine. The distance to the precipice on the lake shore may have been considerable. Man having a rational spirit as well as an animal soul, can be possessed by demons for a long time without physical death resulting, but the same destructive influence quickly kills a lower animal. Mere sensuous life and demoniacal influence stand in some relation; hence this is a warning against sensualism. The permission given by our Lord to enter the herd of swine can be readily justified. It suggests the above warning, it helped to rid the men of the demons; there may have been other reasons growing out of the Mosaic law, which make the loss of property a just punishment; and after all it was but a permission. Criticism of the conduct of Jesus on this occasion only proves His immaculateness.
