<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:4">Matthew 8:4</span>. <strong> See thou tell no man </strong> <em> i.e</em>., do not stop to blaze it abroad, but <strong> go thy way, </strong> go directly <strong> and show thyself to the priest. </strong> The telling was forbidden until this duty was fulfilled. It is said that the first inspection was performed by the priest of the district, then a second one after seven days, then after purification a visit was made to the temple, where it was the duty of the leper to <strong> offer the gift which Moses commanded.</strong> (See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+14:30-31">Leviticus 14:30-31</span>.) Our Lord adds: <strong> for a testimony to them;</strong> <em> i.e.,</em> a testimony to the people that the cleansing had taken place. Reasons for the command to be silent: Our Lord had in view the welfare of the person healed; He did not wish to hinder the duty Moses had commanded, nor to prejudice the priests who would inspect the man; He thus sought to prevent a concourse of the people, and the enmity of the rulers. The command also implies a caution against making too much of the external miraculous acts of our Lord; a kind of materialism, no less than the denial of the possibility of such miracles.
