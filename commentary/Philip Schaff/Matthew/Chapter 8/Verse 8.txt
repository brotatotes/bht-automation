Matthew 8:8.  The centurion answered, through friends (Luke 7:6).
	 Lord, I am not worthy,  etc. This humility sprang out of his consciousness that he was a heathen, as well as his esteem of our Lord.
	 But only say in a word.  This means one word of command, as Matthew 8:9 shows.
	 And my servant shall be healed.  ‘Humility and faith always go hand in hand.’
