Matthew 9:12. Our Lord, in figurative language, lays down a principle, applicable to the case, on their own estimate of themselves, and the publicans and sinners.â€™
	 They that are whole have no need of physician, but they that are sick. He is the Physician; the two classes are, the objectors and those objected to. Those thinking themselves whole (although really they are not) need not (or do not admit their need of) a physician, but those thinking themselves sick (which is really their case).
