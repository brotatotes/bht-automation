<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:12">Matthew 9:12</span>. Our Lord, in figurative language, lays down a principle, applicable to the case, on their own estimate of themselves, and the publicans and sinners.â€™

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> They that are whole have no need of physician, but they that are sick.</strong> He is the Physician; the two classes are, the objectors and those objected to. Those thinking themselves whole (although really they are not) need not (or do not admit their need of) a physician, but those thinking themselves sick (which is really their case).
