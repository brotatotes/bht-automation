<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:13">Matthew 9:13</span>. <strong> Go ye and learn.</strong> The citation is peculiar to Matthew. ‘You are students of the Scriptures, yet do not know the meaning of the passage I quote; instead of finding fault, go and learn what you ought to know already.’ The Rabbins used such a form.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> I desire mercy and not sacrifice</strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ho+6:6">Hosea 6:6</span>). The Greek translation is here given; the original Hebrew is: ‘mercy rather than sacrifice.’ God prefers mercy to sacrifice, and rejects the latter if it conflicts with the former. This the Pharisees had forgotten in their criticism of His conduct.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> For I came not,</strong> etc. The best authorities omit, ‘to repentance.’ The sense remains unaltered.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The righteous, </strong> are those thinking themselves so, <strong> sinners,</strong> those convinced of their sin; not those actually righteous and sinful. The latter view is admissible; those actually righteous cannot be called to repentance, but this would not assert the existence of positively sinless men. The former view corresponds better with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:12">Matthew 9:12</span>, gives a more direct reply to the Pharisees, and enforces the great lesson of the whole passage; sense of need is the first step toward Christ (comp. the beatitudes).
