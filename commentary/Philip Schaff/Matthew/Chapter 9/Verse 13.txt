Matthew 9:13.  Go ye and learn. The citation is peculiar to Matthew. ‘You are students of the Scriptures, yet do not know the meaning of the passage I quote; instead of finding fault, go and learn what you ought to know already.’ The Rabbins used such a form.
	 I desire mercy and not sacrifice (Hosea 6:6). The Greek translation is here given; the original Hebrew is: ‘mercy rather than sacrifice.’ God prefers mercy to sacrifice, and rejects the latter if it conflicts with the former. This the Pharisees had forgotten in their criticism of His conduct.
	 For I came not, etc. The best authorities omit, ‘to repentance.’ The sense remains unaltered.
	 The righteous,  are those thinking themselves so,  sinners, those convinced of their sin; not those actually righteous and sinful. The latter view is admissible; those actually righteous cannot be called to repentance, but this would not assert the existence of positively sinless men. The former view corresponds better with Matthew 9:12, gives a more direct reply to the Pharisees, and enforces the great lesson of the whole passage; sense of need is the first step toward Christ (comp. the beatitudes).
