<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:14">Matthew 9:14</span>. <strong> The disciples of John.</strong> Luke puts the question in the mouth of the Pharisees, but by this time all the spiritual disciples of John must have become followers of Christ; the rest would lean toward Pharisaism.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft? </strong> Some authorities omit ‘oft,’ but it is better to retain it. The Pharisees, it is supposed, fasted twice in the week (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:12">Luke 18:12</span>); the remnant of John’s disciples would be led to a similar practice, by his austere life. But thy disciples fast not? The complaint also implies: ‘if you are a teacher from God, why does your teaching result in leading your followers away from old-established forms and customs, confirmed by the example of our own teacher, John.’ A demand for a compromise between the old and the new, as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:16">Matthew 9:16</span> shows. External legalism here assumed to teach Christ; and John’s disciples borrowed aid from the Pharisees whom John denounced.
