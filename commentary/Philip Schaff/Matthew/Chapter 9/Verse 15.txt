Matthew 9:15.  Can the sons of the bridechamber. The companions of the bridegroom, as the bride was brought to his father’s house. The festive procession was usually in the evening, with torches, music, and dancing, and the marriage feast lasted seven days. The application is of course to the disciples of Christ; He Himself being the bridegroom. A common Old Testament figure. There may also be an allusion to the words of the Baptist (John 3:29) in which he represents himself as the friend of the bridegroom, Christ ‘Mourn’ and ‘fast’ are used interchangeably; genuine fasting springs from real sorrow.
	 But days will come, etc. ‘How sublime and peaceful is this early announcement by our Lord of the bitter passage before Him’ (Alford).
	 Then they will fast. A simple prediction, not a command, hence ‘will,’ instead of ‘shall.’ Real fasting takes place where there is real occasion for it. History shows that prescribed fasts become formal; that formal fasting is closely linked with Pharisaical ritualism.
