Matthew 9:16. Two illustrations follow, naturally associated with a wedding feast
	 No one putteth a patch of undressed,  or, ‘unfulled’  cloth upon an old garment.  The patch of cloth that would shrink, placed on a worn garment, would tear the weaker fibre;  and a worse rent takes place,  since the new rent is all round the patch that covered the old one. What is  antiquated  cannot be patched up with what is  fresh. The worn out system of fasting for fasting’s sake cannot be patched up with a piece from the new, fresh, complete gospel. It is often attempted. Many special applications may be made, but care must be taken that nothing directly appointed by God be deemed ‘antiquated.’
