<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:17">Matthew 9:17</span>. <strong> Neither do men put new wine into</strong> <strong> old skins,</strong> etc. The skin-bottles common in the East Old ones would burst from the fermenting of the new wine, which would distend new ones without injury. This figure, representing an internal operation, is stronger than the previous one. The living principle of the new covenant, if we attempt to enclose it in the old ceremonial man, is lost, <strong> the wine runneth out, and the skim perish; </strong> even the form is destroyed.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> But they put new wine into fresh skins.</strong> The second adjective is not the same as the first. New emergencies require new means. In this case, God had appointed the new means. The former figure seems most applicable to the mistake of Johnâ€™s disciples; the latter to the subsequent dangers besetting the Apostles. Judaistic Christianity died, form and spirit were destroyed; but the freedom of the gospel for which Paul contended remained. The new life assumes an outward form, differing from the antiquated form, and we must seek to preserve both life and form: <strong> both are preserved together.
