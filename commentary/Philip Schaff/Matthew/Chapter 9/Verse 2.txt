Matthew 9:2. The accounts of Mark and Luke are more particular.
	 And, merely resumes the narrative, without implying connection with what precedes.
	 Behold.  A remarkable miracle. Luke intimates that many other cures were performed just before, and both he and Mark mention the crowd. The account of the latter renders it probable that this took place in the house where He generally resided.
	 They brought to him a paralytic.  Not being able to enter the house, the four who bore him carried him to the housetop, and, actually breaking up the roof, let him down (Mark).
	 Lying, or, more literally, ‘laid,’ on a bed.
	 Seeing their faith,  not only of the bearers, but of the man himself, since what follows shows his strong faith.
	 Son,  be of good cheer. Words of affectionate address, fully given by Matthew alone. ‘Son’ implies that a new relation was now to exist between them, since Christ thus addressed His chosen disciples (Mark 10:24). The ‘good cheer’ came before the bodily healing, as a result of a purely spiritual blessing.
	 Thy sins are forgiven.  A positive declaration, ‘they have been, and are now forgiven.’ Certainly not a concession to the popular notion that such sickness was a direct judgment for sin. There is no proof that the disease was in this case the fruit of indulgence. The man’s conscience was aroused through his sickness; our Lord first of all gives him spiritual health; afterwards bodily health; proving His authority to pardon by His power to cure, He thus places ‘forgiveness’ not only before but above miraculous healing. The general connection between sin and suffering is assumed throughout.
