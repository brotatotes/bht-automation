Matthew 9:21.  If I do but touch, etc. ‘May’ should be omitted; she was timid, not doubtful. It is implied that she wished only to touch some part of His clothes, no matter which. She may have looked for some magical influence, but twelve years in the hands of physicians in those days would certainly excuse such a thought in a weak woman.
