<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:23">Matthew 9:23</span>. Matthew passes over the message, that the damsel was dead; the faith of the ruler already strengthened by the miracle was further encouraged by the words, ‘Be not afraid, only believe’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:36">Mark 5:36</span>). Only Peter, James, and John (Mark and Luke) were allowed to follow Jesus into the ruler’s house.

<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> The minstrels, </strong> <em> i.e.</em>, the flute players, who attended funerals.

<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> And the</strong> <strong> crowd in a tumult. </strong> There was always a horrible clamor at Eastern funerals; and the preparations had begun, for early burial was usual among the Jews. The lamentation often began as the last breath left the body. From the fact that the crowd outside was dismissed, and the crowd inside driven out, we infer, not so much, not to crowd the Saviour, as not to crowd into family grief, and rudely enter the sacred circle of deepest sorrow.
