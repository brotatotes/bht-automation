Matthew 9:24.  Give place. A request for the crowd to retire.
	 For the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. A direct reference to the miracle, which He was about to perform. She did not die, as others die; but she is as one who sleepeth, for I am about to raise her, as one is wakened from a sleep. The same words were used of Lazarus, in whose case the actual raising from actual death is distinctly affirmed (John 11:11; John 11:14; John 11:44). There is also a deeper and more general meaning; for Christ has, by His own resurrection and His promise to raise believers, declared death to be but   a sleep.
	 And they laughed him to scorn. They laughed Him down, not sharing the fatherâ€™s faith.
