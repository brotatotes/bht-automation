<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> For the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.</strong> A direct reference to the miracle, which He was about to perform. She did not die, as others die; but she is as one who sleepeth, for I am about to raise her, as one is wakened from a sleep. The same words were used of Lazarus, in whose case the actual raising from actual death is distinctly affirmed (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:11">John 11:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:14">John 11:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:44">John 11:44</span>). There is also a deeper and more general meaning; for Christ has, by His own resurrection and His promise to raise believers, declared death to be but <strong> </strong> a sleep.
