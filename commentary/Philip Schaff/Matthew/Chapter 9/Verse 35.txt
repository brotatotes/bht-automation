<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:35">Matthew 9:35</span>. <strong> And Jesus went about</strong>, etc. An appropriate introduction to what follows, as well as a fitting close to this account of the leading miracles performed by our Lord; almost identical with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:23">Matthew 4:23</span>, which precedes the Sermon on the Mount, describing (as the tense in the original shows) a customary course of action. Luke indicates three journeys through Galilee, the second of which precedes the journey to Gadara, and is mentioned by him alone. If this verse refers to a journey distinct from that spoken of in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:23">Matthew 4:23</span>, it must be the third. This third circuit seems to have begun before the Apostles were sent out (chap. 10 ), and to have continued until their return. The verse may, however, be only a general description of Christâ€™s ministry, closing the group of miracles.
