Matthew 9:38.  Beseech ye.  A strong word.
	 The Lord of the harvest,   i.e., God. The harvest included the Gentile nations, for the laborers sent forth at this time afterwards preached to them also.
	 That he send forth laborers into his harvest.  Real laborers are needed, but only such as God sends forth. This prayer to the Lord of the harvest was first answered in the sending forth of laborers (the Twelve) by Christ. The mention of a ‘shepherd’ (Matthew 9:36) suggests that the prayer should be for efficient laborers who are good pastors. New pastors now came to replace the old, oppressive ones who were appointed by law and not impelled by the Spirit.
