This prayer to the Lord of the harvest was first answered in the sending forth of laborers (the Twelve) by Christ. The mention of a ‘shepherd’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:36">Matthew 9:36</span>) suggests that the prayer should be for efficient laborers who are good pastors. New pastors now came to replace the old, oppressive ones who were appointed by law and not impelled by the Spirit.
