<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:4">Matthew 9:4</span>. <strong> Knowing,</strong> by divine insight, rather than from the expression of their countenances.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts.</strong> A rebuke of the substance and the secrecy of their opposition. Bold language; it assumes, that opposition to Christâ€™s power to forgive sins is in itself wicked. Our Lord thus claims much for His Person. According to the usual chronology, this was the first indication of hostility on the part of the Pharisees, although in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:1">John 4:1</span>, there is a hint that this existed. If <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:0">John 5:0</span> precedes the Galilean ministry, they had already sought to kill Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:16">John 5:16</span>). The usual view, however, places that feast immediately after the call of Matthew. The Pharisees may have objected to a declaration of absolution without the sacrifice required by the law. Pharisaism has often opposed such direct absolution, calling for priestly intervention.
