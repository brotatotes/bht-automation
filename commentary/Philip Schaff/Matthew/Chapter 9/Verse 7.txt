Matthew 9:7.  And he arose, and departed to his house.  The test was successfully applied. The intervening moment must have been one of suspense to all, save the Healer and the healed; the one serene in the consciousness of power, the other strong in faith. His walk was truly ‘by faith,’ and he went ‘glorifying God.’ (Luke 5:25.)
