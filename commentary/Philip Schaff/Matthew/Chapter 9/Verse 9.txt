<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:9">Matthew 9:9</span>. <strong> From thence.</strong> According to all three accounts, immediately after the miracle just mentioned.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Matthew,</strong> the Apostle and Evangelist ‘A publican named Levi’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:27">Luke 5:27</span>); ‘Levi the son of Alpheus’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:14">Mark 2:14</span>). Undoubtedly the same person; the accounts agree closely. The formal call seems peculiar to the Apostles, and Mark and Luke mention Matthew, not Levi, among the Twelve.

Matthew obeyed in this sense, ‘he left all, rose up, and followed him’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:28">Luke 5:28</span>); certainly not simply; walked after Jesus into His place of residence.
