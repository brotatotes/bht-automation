CONNECTION.   The concluding verses of chap. 9 , referring to a definite occasion, form a fit introduction to an account of the formal sending out of the Apostles. Matthew has already mentioned the first call of some of the Twelve. Mark and Luke tell how they had been chosen as a body some time before, after a night spent in prayer (Luke 7:12). The ministry of our Lord was now assuming a more prominent Messianic character, and having been under His instruction for some time, they are ordained as His chosen messengers. It suits the formal method of Matthew to give a list of the Twelve at this point. According to all three Evangelists, the date is near the close of the second year of our Lordâ€™s ministry.
	 THE TWELVE APOSTLES.   In the four lists given by Matthew (Matthew 10:2-4), Mark (Mark 3:16-19), and Luke (Luke 6:14-16; Acts 1:13), we find the name of Peter  first, that of Philip  fifth, that of James the son of Alpheus  ninth; while between, the same names occur in different order, Judas Iscariot being always put last. The Twelve seem to be thus distinguished into  three sets of  four each.  In the first the four fishermen, who were once partners in business, are placed together. Besides these two pairs of brothers, we have two brothers (perhaps three) in the third set, while Philip and Bartholomew were friends. All but Judas were Galileans, a number had been disciples of John, Our Lord therefore had regard to natural relationship and mental affinity in the construction of the Apostolate, and the same principle holds good in all His dealings with the church. Those friendships and fraternal ties are blessed which are strengthened by common attachment to our Friend and Elder Brother.
	 The rest of the chapter contains the discourse delivered to the Twelve, designed for their immediate mission, but also (especially the latter part) for their greater subsequent work.
