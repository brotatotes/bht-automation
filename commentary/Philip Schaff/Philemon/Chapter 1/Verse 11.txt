The word for ‘unprofitable’ is only a synonym of that which would be derived from Onesimus, so that this verse is rather an allusion to the meaning of the name, than a play upon words, though of the latter, in respect of names, the Jews were very fond. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:20">Philemon 1:20</span>.

<p><strong> but now profitable to thee and to me. </strong> The returning runaway would come back in the spirit which St. Paul inculcates elsewhere, teaching that Christian slaves should count their own masters worthy of all honour (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:1">1 Timothy 6:1</span>). The world, even the Christian world, was <strong> </strong> not advanced far enough to see that slavery was utterly repugnant to the spirit of Christianity. St. Paul to the Corinthians (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:21">1 Corinthians 7:21</span>) only exhorts to contentment under the slave’s condition, and he does not meditate that Philemon should do more for Onesimus <strong> </strong> than treat him with the kindness of a brother in the faith. Men were a long while in learning the lesson against slavery, even good men finding no wrong in it, provided slaves were well cared for. So to Philemon Onesimus is to be profitable in a temporal sense; the profit to St. Paul was that which elsewhere (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:13">Romans 1:13</span>) he calls ‘fruit,’ the result of his missionary labours, which he considered the crown, and glory, and joy of his life.
