<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:2">Philemon 1:2</span>. <strong> And Archippus,</strong> It is clear from the way in which Archippus is addressed (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:17">Colossians 4:17</span>) that he occupied some ministerial office in the Colossian church. The word used there to describe his duty is the same that is employed concerning Timothy (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:5">2 Timothy 4:5</span>). As he is mentioned before the general congregation, he may have been one of the deacons of the Colossian church, and perhaps connected with the family of Philemon.

<p><strong> our fellow-soldier</strong>. This word likewise speaks of the services undertaken by Archippus for the Christian Church. Though he only employs this word once again, St. Paul is extremely fond of the figure of a battle in describing the labours of himself and his fellow-preachers of the Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:4">2 Corinthians 10:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span>).

<p><strong> and to the church in thy house</strong>. The first congregations were formed so speedily after the preaching of the apostles at Pentecost, that there was no possibility of making provision for their accommodation in special buildings. Besides this, the general poverty of the first Christians was a hindrance, and it would, in the early days of the Church, have been somewhat unsafe to give too much prominence to their meetings. Accordingly, we find the Christians of Jerusalem assembled in the house of Mary, the mother of John Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:12">Acts 12:12</span>); and the example of Jerusalem was followed in other places, and the richer members of the congregations provided rooms in their own homes for the religious meetings of their brethren. As this duty was discharged towards the church at Coloss√¶ by Philemon, we may conclude that be was a person of some wealth. St. Paul was led to include the congregation in his salutation, because the runaway slave, who was now returning, came back as a Christian convert, and therefore one with a claim on the sympathy of the whole Church. He thus makes them a party with himself in the petition which he is about to make to Philemon.
