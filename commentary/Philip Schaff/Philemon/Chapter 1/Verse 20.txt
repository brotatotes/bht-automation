He employs the Greek verb from which that name is derived, and the words might be literally rendered, Met me be profited by thee.’ It is as though he would put the matter thus: ‘Onesimus is now about really to deserve to be called “profitable.” He owes much, and <strong> </strong> by his loving service he will make payment. Thou also art greatly my debtor, be thou to me an Onesimus, and let me have profit from thy love.’

<p><strong> refresh my heart in Christ. </strong> See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:7">Philemon 1:7</span>. St. Paul employs the same words which there he used of the kindness that Philemon showed to the Colossian congregation. That was by his liberality. The apostle therefore adds ‘in Christ’ to his own petition, signifying that Christian love to him will be counted as of equal value with those kind services which his riches enabled Philemon to perform towards his fellow-Christians.
