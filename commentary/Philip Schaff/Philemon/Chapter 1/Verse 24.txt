Philemon 1:24.  And to do  Mark.  Doubtless the John Mark who on the first missionary journey had turned back and left Paul and Silas. He had not ceased, however, to work in Christ’s cause, and the apostle’s displeasure had passed away, for Mark had become profitable to him for the ministry (2 Timothy 4:11).
	 Aristarchus.  A Macedonian of Thessalonica (Acts 27:2) who accompanied Paul to Rome, and who appears to have devoted himself to the apostle’s service through the whole imprisonment.
	 Demas,  mentioned like the rest in the Colossian Epistle, but at a later time (2 Timothy 4:10) described as deserting St. Paul for the love of the world.
	 Luke,  elsewhere (Colossians 4:14) called ‘the beloved physician.’ He travelled much with St. Paul, and may have been necessary to the apostle by reason of his bodily infirmities.
	 my fellow-labourers.  By his own efforts and   by those of his companions, St. Paul made it apparent that, even though he were a prisoner, the Word of God was not bound. We often regard the two years at Rome as a time when the apostolic work was stayed. It may well have been the most fruitful period of the apostle’s life, for from his own lips the Roman soldiery learnt the story of the Cross, while the self-sacrificing zeal of his Christian companions was ready to undertake any duty that would prove them deserving of the name of fellow-labourers.
