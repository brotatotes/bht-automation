Whether it be the provision which Philemon had made for the Christian worship at Colossæ, or some help which he had bestowed on the poor of the church, or aid under some greater sufferings, of which we have no account, to which St. Paul here alludes, we are not told; but if we might judge from the verb employed, which implies a   lull or temporary repose, it would seem as though some trouble were in St. Paul’s mind which had been allayed, but yet might rise up again.

The apostle lays aside, as in the greeting, all the authority which his position as evangelist and missionary would have given him, and speaks to Philemon, whose conversion seems to have been St. Paul’s own work (Philemon 1:19), on the level of common Christian brotherhood. No course could have been chosen more likely to move Philemon; no course more like the pattern of Christ, who washed His disciples’ feet, to teach them humility toward each other. If Paul thus deal towards Philemon, how must he behave toward Onesimus?
