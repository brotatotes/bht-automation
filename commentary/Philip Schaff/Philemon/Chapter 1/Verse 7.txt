<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:7">Philemon 1:7</span>. <strong> For I</strong> <strong> had </strong> much joy. Alluding to the time when news of the state of Colossæ, and of the church there, was brought to him in his imprisonment.
	</p>
<p><strong> and </strong> comfort. The support and solace derived from the news enabled him to bear his present sufferings the better.
	</p>
<p><strong> in thy love; </strong> in hearing of the various acts of love which had <strong> </strong> been shown towards all the Christian congregation.
	</p>
<p><strong> because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed. </strong> Whether it be the provision which Philemon had made for the Christian worship at Colossæ, or some help which he had bestowed on the poor of the church, or aid under some greater sufferings, of which we have no account, to which St. Paul here alludes, we are not told; but if we might judge from the verb employed, which implies a <strong> </strong> lull or temporary repose, it would seem as though some trouble were in St. Paul’s mind which had been allayed, but yet might rise up again. To aid in such a case, rather than to such help as a rich man might give through his wealth, the strong language of the text seems to apply.
	</p>
<p><strong> by thee, brother. </strong> A very touching portion of the appeal. The apostle lays aside, as in the greeting, all the authority which his position as evangelist and missionary would have given him, and speaks to Philemon, whose conversion seems to have been St. Paul’s own work (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:19">Philemon 1:19</span>), on the level of common Christian brotherhood. No course could have been chosen more likely to move Philemon; no course more like the pattern of Christ, who washed His disciples’ feet, to teach them humility toward each other. If Paul thus deal towards Philemon, how must he behave toward Onesimus?
