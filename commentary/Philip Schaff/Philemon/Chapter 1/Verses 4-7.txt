 Philemon’s good offices to the Church St. Paul’s thankfulness thereat,  vv. 4-7.
	He has to appeal for an act of forgiveness to be shown to Onesimus; the apostle therefore, in words of deep thankfulness to God, recounts to Philemon the joy which he has felt at hearing of his good deeds to the brethren. Such works were the true fruits of faith. St. Paul makes this conduct of Philemon his warrant for asking that like love may be shown to the runaway, who now comes back as a Christian.
