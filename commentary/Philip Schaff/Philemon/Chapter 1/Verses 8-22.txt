<p><em> The Apostle’s Petition and Arguments in support of it, </em> vv. 8-22.
	</p>
<p>St. Paul lays aside any claim which he might have been bold to make, and entreats that Onesimus may be taken back again. He makes <strong> </strong> this petition as an ambassador for Christ and a prisoner in His cause, and also because Onesimus has become his spiritual son. He asks that he may be received as himself, and states how glad he would have been to retain him, but preferred to send him back, that he might become even dearer to Philemon than he was to himself. He also undertakes to make good what Philemon has lost through his slave, and expresses a hope that his release from prison will soon enable him to come to Colossæ.
