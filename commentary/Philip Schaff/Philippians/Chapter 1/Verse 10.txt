Philippians 1:10.  so that ye may approve the things that are excellent.  Thus their discernment will do its work. To approve, that is, to put to trial, and reject if they be not worthy, all things which offer themselves in the life of men. Such rejection of what is bad implies the acceptance of what is good. Things that are excellent (lit. things that differ) is an expression used only of those things which differ in the way of superiority. Hence ‘prove the things that differ’ is to ‘approve those which are excellent.’
	 that ye may be sincere.  The figure in the Greek word is of something that will bear scrutiny under the bright light of the sun. By making constant choice of the things that are   excellent, the wayfaring Christian comes ever nearer to such a   condition.
	 and without offence.  The sense is both active and passive; having nothing at which others may stumble  i.e., giving no offence in anything; and also void of offence within themselves, blameless as well as harmless.
	 till the day of Christ.  See above on Philippians 1:6. That thus they may be prepared for the judgment whenever it may come.
