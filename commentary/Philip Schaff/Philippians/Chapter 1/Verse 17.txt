<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+1:17">Philippians 1:17</span>. <strong> But the other proclaim Christ of faction.</strong> Here is an explanation of the envy and strife. The word rendered ‘faction’ (Authorised Version, contention) properly implies ‘self-seeking.’ And we know that from the earliest times the Christian communities were troubled by those who sought adherents only that they might glory in their number. St. Paul found much trouble of this kind from the Judaizers in the Galatian congregations, and it was the same spirit which was at work here in Rome.

<p><strong> thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds.</strong> This is the rendering of the oldest Greek text. The received text gives ‘to add affliction to my bonds.’ The affliction which is here meant must perhaps be judged of from the character of those who intended to rouse it up. They were men actuated by a spirit of self-seeking, and could perhaps only understand St. Paul’s work in the light of their own. They would have found it a sore trouble had others attempted to take on them to do that which they regarded as their special work. So it may be they judged of St. Paul, and imagined that their work would be looked on with jealousy by him, and thus affliction be roused up for him because while he lay in prison, others were making themselves heard and known. This certainly is an appropriate sense with the verb ‘to raise up,’ for the idea in it is often of waking up something that is asleep, as the feeling of jealousy might be supposed to be.
