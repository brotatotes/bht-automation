Philippians 1:21.  For to me to live is Christ. My life will be His service wherein I shall consequently enjoy His grace and help. So that it will be work for Christ done through Christ who strengtheneth. This to the zealous apostle was a source of spiritual comfort, but not so great as that of which he next speaks.
	and to die is gain. The former was to have the support of a spiritual communion in this world: this is the greater bliss of being ever present with the Lord. It is the sense of this gain that leads St. Paul to say to the Thessalonians (1 Thessalonians 4:18), when speaking of the approach of the day of Christ, ‘Comfort one another with these words.’
