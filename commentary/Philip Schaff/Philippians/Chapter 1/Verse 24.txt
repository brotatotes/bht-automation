Philippians 1:24.  yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake.  He now approaches a reason which confirms him as to what his lot will be. He sees that there is much which lies before him, which God is showing that he would have him do, and the sense that the churches will be the better for his life, and need his continued care, brings with it the certainty that God will not yet call him home.
