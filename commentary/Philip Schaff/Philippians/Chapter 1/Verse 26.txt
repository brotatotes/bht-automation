Philippians 1:26.  that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me.  The noun here used, ‘glorying,’ and its kindred verb, are favourite words with St. Paul. They signify primarily ‘boasting,’ but like so many words which have been taken by the New Testament diction for its own, they have received a modification of meaning. The Christian man may boast, but it can never be of himself, but of what in mercy has been done for him, and such boasting becomes a glorification of his Lord. Hence the apostle’s sentence means that the Philippians may have more and more cause for such boasting in Christ Jesus for His grace bestowed, and so their glorying may be said to be in Christ Jesus. But St. Paul’s own lessons and example and prayers will be a means for attaining the grace of Christ, and so he is able to add ‘in me.’ The boasting will be of what the Lord hath done, and the help thereto will be Paul’s continuance in the flesh.
