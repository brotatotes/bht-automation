<p><strong> not only to believe on him, but</strong> <strong> also to suffer in his behalf. </strong> The sentence is shaped as though St. Paul had at the outset meant to speak of the sufferings first: ‘It is given you to suffer in behalf of Christ;’ but the change which is introduced by the thought ‘not only to believe on Him’ necessitates a repetition of the first portion of the clause, ‘in his behalf.’ ‘In his behalf’ implies for the sake of all that will help to spread His gospel.
