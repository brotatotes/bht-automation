Philippians 1:3.  I thank my God.  This expression is very frequent with St. Paul, and indicates the light in which he looked on God’s dealing with him. He could see that all was of God’s grace, and so   his life was   a constant eucharist
	 upon all my remembrance of you. It was not that on every occasion on which the apostle’s thoughts went back to the Philippians he felt thankful, but the whole course of the remembrance, as their Christian progress was reviewed by him since his earliest preaching among them, gives him reason for thankfulness. It is this which makes the tone of the Epistle so jubilant. The apostle’s heart is overflowing with thankfulness to God, and happiness in the manifestation of their love to himself.
