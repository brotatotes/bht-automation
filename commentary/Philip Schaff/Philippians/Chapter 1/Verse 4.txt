<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+1:4">Philippians 1:4</span>. <strong> Always in every prayer of mine for you all. </strong> We see here how the apostleâ€™s thankful-ness manifested itself. There was cause for joy over the Philippian church. Feeling this, St. Paul comes to God with supplication, that as they now stand, so they may continue, and only change to a greater advancement in grace and holiness. Of course concerning the new converts the apostle could know nothing but from the reports brought by Epaphroditus and others, but they are all become his brethren in Christ, and therefore all have a claim, a right, to a share in his prayers.

<p><strong> making my supplication with joy. </strong> The joy would have many sources. It would come in part from the retrospect of the history of the Philippian church to which he has just alluded; and in part from the most recent manifestations of their love during his present imprisonment.
