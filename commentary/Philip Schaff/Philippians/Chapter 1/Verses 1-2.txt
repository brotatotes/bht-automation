 Address and Greeting,  1, 2.
	In this greeting, St. Paul, writing to a congregation to which he was much attached, and which had shown great zeal and love toward him, does not sneak   so much in the character of the apostle with authority, but as their founder and the friend of the whole church, whose ministers he salutes in a   manner not found in the other Epistles.
