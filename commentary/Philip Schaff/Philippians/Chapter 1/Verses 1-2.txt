<p><em> Address and Greeting, </em> 1, 2.
	</p>
<p>In this greeting, St. Paul, writing to a congregation to which he was much attached, and which had shown great zeal and love toward him, does not sneak <strong> </strong> so much in the character of the apostle with authority, but as their founder and the friend of the whole church, whose ministers he salutes in a <strong> </strong> manner not found in the other Epistles.
