<p><em> The Progress of the Gospel in</em> <strong><em> </em></strong> <em> Rome St. Paul’s desire to depart His Exhortation and Encouragement to the Philippians, </em> 12-30,
	</p>
<p>In spite of St. Paul’s imprisonment, the Gospel has not been bound, and even those who are not sincere in their preaching of it, yet are a joy to the apostle, because a faint light is better than heathen darkness. But yet he would fain go out of the world and be with Christ, but his heart tells him that this is not to be his portion: he is to abide in the flesh for the sake of the churches. He accompanies the statement of this conviction with an exhortation to stedfastness and unity, while he bids them have no fear from adversaries. That adversaries assail them is a happy sign. God of His grace permits His faithful servants not only to believe in, but to suffer for, Christ.
