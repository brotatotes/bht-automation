<p><em> Thanksgivings and Prayers, </em> 3-11.
	</p>
<p>The apostle gives the tone to his Epistle in this opening clause. He is thankful for what he knows of the past conduct of the Philippians, and looks forward with confidence. But the strength to perform is from God, and therefore he mingles his rejoicing with constant prayer. God, who began <strong> </strong> the good work, will carry it forward; this St. Paul knew from his own experience, and the Philippians are sharers in his grace. He prays for their increase in love, in knowledge, in sincerity, which growth can be only made manifest through bringing forth fruits of righteousness in their lives.
