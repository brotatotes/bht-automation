<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+2:14">Philippians 2:14</span>. <strong> Do all things without murmurings and disputings. </strong> Two hindrances are here contemplated to the right employment of the will and power which it is God’s good pleasure to bestow, There may rise within men a disappointment at the work to which God sends them, and thus they may murmur and complain instead of labouring as He intends; or they may stand still and not move, because they think more light should be vouchsafed before they make any attempt at progress. St. Paul’s own experience, and indeed that of all who walk as he walked, is that God does not always make all pleasing or all plain. Often men have to wait and be content with the message which St. Paul received, ‘Rise and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou shalt do.’ If they go in faith as the blinded apostle went, then the scales fall off.
