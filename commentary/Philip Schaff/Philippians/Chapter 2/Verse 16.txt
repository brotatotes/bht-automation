Philippians 2:16.  Holding forth the word of life.  Here also there seems to be a double application possible of the verb ‘holding forth.’ It may mean ‘setting forth’ by your conduct, what the word of life has been able to do for you: how it has made your life a real one, and done it by directing you to the life eternal; or it may imply that Christians are to act the part of evangelists, and carry to others the glad tidings, from which they draw such joy for themselves. The ‘word of life’ in either case is the Gospel of Christ, showing itself in its effects, or preached by His messengers.
	 that I may have whereof to glory.  This is a strong phrase, but somewhat frequent in St. Paul’s writings. When it is read in the light of its use in other places, such as ‘God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,’ we can understand its meaning here. It is used in no sense of boasting over his own work, but in a sense of exultation over the victories won for Christ.
	 in the day of Christ.  When He shall appear as judge, to take account of the work of all men.
	 that I have not ran in vain. Also a figure of frequent occurrence with St. Paul, and appealing to the feelings of the Gentiles, among whom races of all kinds were a frequent spectacle. His whole life was a race for souls, ‘If by any means I may save some.’ We may well understand then the feeling of exultation when he contemplates such a church as that which he had been privileged to found in Philippi.
	 neither laboured in vain. The word implies labour of great difficulty, and weariness, and is constantly applied by St. Paul to the toils which he and others underwent in their missionary journeys (2 Corinthians 11:23; 1 Thessalonians 2:9, etc.).
