Philippians 2:18.  and in the same manner do ye also joy and rejoice with me. There are two offerings in the contemplation of St. Paul: his own, as he is poured out on the sacrifice; the offering of the faithful lives of the Philippians which they themselves are to make. He does not intimate whether the power of Rome, or his own continued toils, shall be the agency employed to pour his life forth. But both offerings are subjects for joy. He cannot restrain his triumph at the one, and in like manner he bids his friends feel equal joy at the offering which he is making and being strengthened to make unto his Master.
