<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+2:2">Philippians 2:2</span>. <strong> fulfil ye my joy.</strong> The Philippian church had already caused him much joy (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+4:1-10">Philippians 4:1-10</span>): there is, however, one thing yet wanting. He has little blame to bring against them, but there is reported to him some want among them of unity of spirit, and the apostle’s joy will not be complete till this is attained.

<p><strong> that ye be of the same </strong> mind, <em> lit. </em> think the same thing. An expression indicative of most complete unity, the high ideal after which the Christian must strive, and which Christ invokes in His prayer ‘that they all may be one.’ The apostle proceeds to indicate the means whereby an advance towards this ideal may be furthered.
	</p>
<p><strong> having the same</strong> <strong> love. </strong> All striving alike after this highest Christian grace, and not being content to be surpassed by any in this struggle. Thus would they all increase and abound in love toward one another and toward all <strong> </strong> men. This relates to the inward feeling to be cultivated.
	</p>
<p><strong> being of one accord, </strong> having the same desires, and aiming at the same objects. Thus would their outward behaviour and pursuits be no source of strife.
	</p>
<p><strong> of one mind</strong>. Thus his language reaches a climax in this strengthened form of the first clause. It crowns the whole work if such unity be reached that the minds are not alike only, but feel as one.
