<p><strong> who will care truly for your state. </strong> This word ‘truly’ is used by Paul in another place of Timothy (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:2">1 Timothy 1:2</span>), where he styles him ‘his true child in the faith.’ We can see then that the sense here is ‘genuinely,’ and the ‘care’ <em> </em> is that intense anxiety which St. Paul speaks of (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:28">2 Corinthians 11:28</span>) as his own lot in ‘the care of all the churches.’ It is the thought which admits no rest till the object of it is quite secured, and hardly then, but finds new anxiety for itself.
