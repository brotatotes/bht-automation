<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+2:21">Philippians 2:21</span>. <strong> For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ. </strong> We find other times in St. Paul’s life when this bitter sense came upon him. So when he writes (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:10-11">2 Timothy 4:10-11</span>), ‘Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world . . . only Luke is with me.’ In the ‘things of Jesus Christ’ we must not only understand all that is connected with the preaching and advancement of the Gospel, but such matters also as most nearly concerned the apostle himself, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, as he elsewhere calls himself. In this we can see the reason why, till the course which events would take was better known, he could not suffer Timothy to leave him.
