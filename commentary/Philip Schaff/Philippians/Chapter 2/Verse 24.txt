Philippians 2:24.  But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.  Here he uses the same adverb of his own coming which he had used in Philippians 2:19 of the sending of Timothy. We can see the great naturalness of the language here. As he writes of Timothy’s visit, his heart warms and his hopes rise at the thought, and soon he advances from ‘shortly’ to ‘forthwith,’ and looks forward to his own journey consequently as nearer at hand. Here, as before, he does not let his hopes obscure the thought that his coming or absence is in the hands of the Lord.
