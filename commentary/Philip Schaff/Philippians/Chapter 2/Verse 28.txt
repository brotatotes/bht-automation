Philippians 2:28.  I have sent him therefore the more diligently.  That is, because of his longing to return, and because I desired that he should be restored to health, for which result this was the surest means. ‘Diligently’ indicates that St. Paul had allowed no time to elapse after the recovery of Epaphroditus before he sent him away. The whole language bespeaks the tenderness of the apostle both for the sick man and his friends at home. Though he found solace and help in his presence, he would keep him no moment longer than was needful.
