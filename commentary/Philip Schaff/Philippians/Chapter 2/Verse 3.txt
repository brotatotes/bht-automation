<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+2:3">Philippians 2:3</span>. <strong> Do nothing through faction or through vain-glory. </strong> There is no verb expressed in the original, but this in such an earnest exhortation is at once supplied. The reading which introduces the two prepositions is to be preferred, and in that form the two distinct evils against which St. Paul is speaking are more clearly noted. He is exhorting to unity, and he knows that there are no greater foes thereto, than that party spirit which causes men to take sides on any question, and mars their oneness of aim, or that empty self-conceit which fills a man with undue esteem for himself, and so makes his self-importance range him in opposition to everybody else. Against both these he warns them. Through a misconception of its derivation, the word rendered ‘faction’ is constantly in the Authorised Version translated ‘strife.’ The two Greek words thus connected have nothing to do with one another, and though ‘faction’ may lead to ‘strife,’ we can hardly speak of strife as a motive for action in the same way as we do of ‘party spirit’ or ‘faction.’
