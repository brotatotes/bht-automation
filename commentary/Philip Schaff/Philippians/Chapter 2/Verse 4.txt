Philippians 2:4.  not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.  According to the best texts, this is another participial sentence continuing the explanation of means towards attaining the great end of oneness of mind. The apostle does not exhort men to cease to look to their own things, for he knows this would be impossible, but he would have them, as they look to their own, in the same degree to look to the things of others. Another form of the precept ‘to love one’s neighbour as oneself.’ St. Paul uses the indefinite phrases, ‘his own things,’ ‘the things of others,’ because he would make his exhortation apply to all men at all times. He includes in it every interest of whatever kind by which men are bound to one another. And by the word ‘look’ he would make each of us a watchman, ever on the look-out lest in thought for himself, he is missing any occasion where he should equally think for his brethren.
