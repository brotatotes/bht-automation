 Exhortations to unity and humility enforced by the example of Christ,  1-11.
	Following up the exhortation with which the last chapter closed, that the Philippians should stand fast in one spirit, the apostle proceeds with a like teaching. He takes for granted that they have found in Christ consolation under the trials which have befallen them, also that the love of their fellow-Christians has yielded them comfort, and that through the Spirit they feel inward communion with all the brethren, and therefore they are moved by loving-kindness and compassion. Let them show these feelings towards him that he may rejoice over them, and towards one another, that they may learn and practise humility. This was the great lesson of Christâ€™s life on earth. He had been with God, and was God Himself, from all eternity, and had no need to make a struggle for the Divine character, which was His already. Yet from this majesty He, of His own will, came down, and took the nature of humanity, and endured its greatest humiliations, even submitting to die upon the Cross. For such display of lowliness He is now at the right hand of God, exalted, and to he worshipped by the whole creation as Lord of all, to the glory of God the Father.
