 Exhortations to advance in the way of salvation, to be lights in the world and a joy to the apostle,   12-18.
	Having set before them the perfect example of Christ as an incentive to unity of mind, the apostle continues his exhortation, urging them to diligence in their Christian course, that they may prove themselves conscientious and worthy of the work which God has begun   within them. Let them avoid murmurings and disputes, and thus by the light of their Christian example they may lead others from perverse ways, and may rejoice the apostleâ€™s own soul with the feeling that he has not laboured in vain. If only they bring their faithful service as an offering to God, he will rejoice with them, and bids them rejoice also, even if his life-blood have to be poured out, as the libation poured over a victim in a sacrifice.
