 Of his intention soon to send Timothy, and of the immediate return of Epaphroditus,  19-30.
	The apostle now turns to personal matters about which he is sure from their behaviour that they will be interested. I hope, he says, soon to be able to part with my companion Timothy and send him to you. He will bring me word of the condition of the Philippian church, and is truly attached to your welfare, since he was with me on my first visit. Others have interests of their own, he like a child treads faithfully in my steps, works in all things as I work. I do not know what turn my cause may take, but when that is known, I shall send him to you. And I am not without hope that I myself may be set at liberty and come to you soon. Your messenger, Epaphroditus, I send at once. Thus will your anxiety be relieved, and his mind be comforted. He has been at death’s door through his labours in my behalf. But God was merciful to me as well as to him, and spared him. When he arrives at home, treasure him much for his work’s sake.
