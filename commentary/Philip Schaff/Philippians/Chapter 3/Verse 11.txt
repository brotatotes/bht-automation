Philippians 3:11.  if by any means I may attain unto the resurrection from the dead. This is not the language of despondency, but of humility. St. Paul hopes, because he relieves in Christ; but not seldom does his low estimate of himself lead him to speak in language like this, ‘lest I myself should be a castaway.’ By the ‘resurrection from the dead,’ he means that resurrection in which the righteous will have share. At the last day all will rise, and in that rising he is sure to have his part; but he desires to feel a confidence beyond this, and to attain to be among those who shall be Christ’s at His coming.
