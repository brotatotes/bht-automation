Philippians 3:16.  Only, whereunto we have already attained, by that same   rule   let us walk.  The final words of this verse, in the Authorised Version, ‘Let us mind the same thing’ are not supported by the oldest MSS., add nothing to the sense, and appear to be a gloss which from the margin has made its way into the text. The verse itself is an enforcement of what he has been saying before. Those who would attain the prize must run, those who would have more light and knowledge must make a right use of that which they have obtained.
