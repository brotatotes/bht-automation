<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+3:17">Philippians 3:17</span>. <strong> Brethren, be ye imitators together of me.</strong> ‘Fellow-imitators’ would be the literal rendering of the noun in this clause, and it intimates that the apostle desires every one of the Philippians to join in this imitation; and not only so, but to vie with one another in their zeal in doing so, and yet to do what is only possible in the Christian race, each to seek to help his neighbour forward, as well as to make progress himself.

<p><strong> and mark them which so walk, even as ye have us for an ensample.</strong> Just as to the Romans (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:17">Romans 16:17</span>) he counsels that they should mark them that cause divisions for avoidance, so the apostle and those like him are to be looked at for imitation. It is possible to take the clause as equivalent to ‘which so walk as I walk, according as ye have,’ etc., or ‘which walk in such wise as ye have us for an example;’ but the former seems to suit the Greek best. So that the connection of the verse would be: Imitate roe, and mark those who walk as I do, according as you have us (both them and me) for a copy.
