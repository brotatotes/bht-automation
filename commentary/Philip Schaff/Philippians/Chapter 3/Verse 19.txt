<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+3:19">Philippians 3:19</span>. <strong> whose end is destruction.</strong> And as St. Peter says (ii 3), this destruction does not slumber, it will soon come. The heresies of destruction, which they bring in, will in the end bring swift destruction upon themselves.
	</p>
<p><strong> whose god is the belly.</strong> The apostle has spoken of such men already to the Romans. ‘They serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly.’
	</p>
<p><strong> and whose glory is in their shame </strong> that is, in what ought to be their shame; but instead of this, they make a parade of what they do, ‘foaming out their own shame.’
	</p>
<p><strong> who mind earthly things.</strong> For such men the upward heavenly calling of God has no attraction. They are given up to what is base, the satisfaction of the momentary desires of the senses, and therein they live entirely, grovelling like the beasts.
