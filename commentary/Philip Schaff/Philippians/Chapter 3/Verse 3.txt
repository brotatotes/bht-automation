<p><strong> who worship by the Spirit of God.</strong> This is the reading of the oldest authorities. The word rendered ‘worship’ is applied primarily and most frequently to external acts and ceremonial observances. St. Paul chooses it advisedly, and says, not that there will be no outward observances on the part of Christians, but that their external worship will also be done from an internal prompting of the Spirit of God. They will worship in the Spirit, because God’s Spirit will animate all they do.

<p><strong> and have no confidence in the flesh.</strong> The feeling which John the Baptist rebuked in the Jews, that they were sure of God’s mercy because they had ‘Abraham to their father,’ had eaten all the heart out of the Jewish nation, and had made them attentive, only to the letter of the law, forgetting its spirit.
