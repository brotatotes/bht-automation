Philippians 3:4.  Though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh. If those things on which the Judaizers lay such stress were of any account, I could glory as largely as any. He mentions this that he may bring out into stronger contrast the small value (or rather no-value) which he sets on outward position and observances. He had stood in a prominent place among those who could call themselves Abrahamâ€™s seed. Few could number so many distinctive marks of Jewish purity and observance. How thoroughly, then, must he have seen the unimportance of all this, who could cast all away and count it worthless for Christ!
	 if any other man thinketh to have confidence in the flesh, I yet more. That is, I have a right to think so still more than he. He does not mean that he does so think, though in words he says so. He is only meeting for a moment the Judaizers on their own ground.
