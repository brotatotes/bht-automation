 Preparation to conclude, interrupted by a digression on false teaching,  3-16.
	St. Paul has now touched on all the topics on which he is about to write to the Philippians as their special concern, and prepares for a reiteration such as is found in his other Epistles. But moved, it may be, by the prevalence of Judaizing teachers in Rome, or by news of the doings of such men in some of the other churches for which he was interested, he introduces, even to the Philippians, a solemn warning against them. He spares them in nothing: they are dogs who mutilate the flesh for mutilationâ€™s sake; while the apostle, and those who worship in the Spirit, are the true circumcision. He himself has all the outward grounds of glorying which the most confident of these false teachers can rely on, but all this he has learnt to value as nothing for the knowledge of Christ. For His sake St. Paul counts all else as refuse, and seeks only to found in Him, having attained unto that righteousness which is not to be reached through law, but through faith in Christ, that dying with Christ and for Christ in this world he may attain unto the resurrection from the dead.
	But this righteousness of faith is not attained unto without labour, nor held fast without a struggle. The apostle, though strong in faith, feels that his course is still not ended; he must forget all that is behind, and press on to what is before him, as a runner hastening with all his speed toward the prize. For this reason, he urges like thoughts and like actions on the Philippians, assuring them that if they have not yet reached the same view and estimate which he sets before them, yet if they will but walk and live according to that light which they have attained, more light will be bestowed on them from God.
