 What Examples are    to be followed, and what to be avoided,  17-21.
	Having set before the Philippians the necessity for walking in the light which each has, St. Paul now points them to his own life, and the lives of those who are   like him, for an example. They will see other lives, against which he has before warned them, which are led by men who are foes of the Christian faith. Such shall be destroyed, for they make their appetites their God, glory in what is shameful, and heed nothing of the heavenly calling. The true Christian thinks of heaven as his city, and looks for Christ to come again from thence, as a Saviour who shall change the body of manâ€™s humiliation, that it may be like that body of His glory in which He ascended into heaven. This will He do, for all power is given unto Him, and He can make all things subject unto Himself.
