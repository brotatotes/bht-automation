<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+4:12">Philippians 4:12</span>. <strong> I know how to be abased.</strong> This was his ‘imitation of Christ,’ of whom, using the same word he has before said, ‘He humbled Himself’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+2:8">Philippians 2:8</span>), and be employs the same expression where he is speaking to the Corinthians (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:7">2 Corinthians 11:7</span>) of preaching the Gospel without being chargeable unto them. ‘Did I commit a sin in <em> abasing </em> myself. . . because I preached to you the Gospel of God for nought?’ In this sort of abasement he continually trained himself.

<p><strong> and I know also how to abound. </strong> In what way to use abundance, when it comes to me, as now, in such wise as to glorify God thereby. The abundance which the Philippians had supplied furnishes the apostle with many themes of joy and thanksgiving, and many words of edification for those who had shown their love to him.

<p><strong> in everything and in all things. </strong> In each particular state into which I may be brought, and the changes in my life have been so various that I may say I have known all states; in each and all I have learned the secret. The word is most commonly applied to the admission of persons into the heathen mysteries by an initiation. St. Paul takes the word which has much savour of the rites to which it has from of old belonged, and uses it (and so purifies it) for the expression of his own initiation. He would intimate thereby that there is a mystery, a paradox, in the Christian life, as he says elsewhere, ‘having nothing, and yet possessing all things.’

<p><strong> both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.</strong> He had known both lots, and was prepared for either, just as it pleased God to send.
