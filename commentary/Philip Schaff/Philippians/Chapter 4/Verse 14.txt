Philippians 4:14.  Howbeit ye did well, that ye had fellowship with my affliction. The apostle through the sustaining power of Christ would surely, he feels, have been supported to do the work for which the Lord was pleased to use him; yet it was good that the Philippians sent him aid, for it was a proof of their own stedfastness in the faith, and was a service rendered not to the apostle only, but to the whole cause of Christ through their example, and so was acceptable unto God. Thus a far higher end was served than the support of Paul the prisoner at Rome. And their action showed still more, that the Philippians suffered in the apostleâ€™s suffering, took their part not only in supplying his bodily needs, but so far as sympathy could do it, in sharing his persecution.
