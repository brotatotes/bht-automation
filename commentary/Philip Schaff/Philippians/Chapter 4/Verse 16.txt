<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+4:16">Philippians 4:16</span>. <strong> For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need.</strong> The hurried departure of the apostle from Philippi gave little time for arranging a provision for his further support and journeying, and the condition to which he had been reduced by the scourging made it impossible that he should attempt, for a time at least, to work with his hands. We can therefore picture the congregation in Philippi gathering together what they could at once, and then sending, as they were collected, further supplies for the apostle’s needs. St. Paul writes literally, ‘even once and twice,’ but we need not take the sense to be that relief was sent on only two occasions. The meaning is well given by our ‘once and again.’ We can see from the history in the Acts, that communication was easy between the towns of Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berœa.
