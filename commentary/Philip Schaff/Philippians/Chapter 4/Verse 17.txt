Philippians 4:17.  Not that I seek for the gift. He has been praising, and with good reason, the unique liberality of the Philippians, but he will not leave them in doubt about the main reason why he is delighted therewith. Had it only represented material aid, it would have found scant praise from him, but he knows that it is the indication of spiritual life and faith.
	 but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account. Once more he goes back to the accountant’s phrase. He cannot repay them what they have given. He can only keep in the records of his heart the memory of their much love. But the account is kept elsewhere for them, and to their benefit goes on increasing. In the word ‘fruit’ there is implied the interest on that which is laid out, and which God reckons on to their credit. So St. Paul, in the great Householder’s eye, is to the Philippians as ‘an exchanger,’ with whom, when they bestow their talent, it shall gain its usury, and they shall in no wise lose their reward. This, the treasure laid up in heaven for the faithful servants, is that which the apostle seeks for. Not theirs does he desire, unless as a sign that he has gained them for Christ.
