<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+4:19">Philippians 4:19</span>. <strong> And my God shall fulfil every need of yours.</strong> The thought is continuous. God, my God, is well pleased, and He will not forget your love shown to me His servant, but repay you in your need. So ‘and’ is better than ‘but,’ as Authorised Version. And God’s return shall be abundant, and always bestowed.

<p><strong> according to his riches.</strong> And if the Lord of all things be the bestower, how large must be the gift, a gift which looks on beyond what can be enjoyed in this world! The full return will only be gained when God Himself is seen and known.
	</p>
<p><strong> in glory. </strong> This refers to the state in which the full recompense will be given. It will be bestowed by the ‘Father of glory’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:17">Ephesians 1:17</span>), and will be a share of ‘the riches of the glory of His inheritance.’
	</p>
<p><strong> in Christ Jesus.</strong> The union with Christ will constitute the chiefest reward. It is not ‘by’ Christ that the fulfilment will be wrought, but He Himself shall be the fulness of their joy.
