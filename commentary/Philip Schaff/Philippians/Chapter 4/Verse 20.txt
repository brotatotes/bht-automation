<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+4:20">Philippians 4:20</span>. <strong> Now unto our God and Father be the glory.</strong> This is a more exact rendering of the original. The pronoun goes with both nouns, and ‘the glory’ is that which essentially belongs to God. It might therefore be well to make the verse a direct statement: ‘To our God . . . <em> is </em> the glory,’ etc., and hence it is His to bestow on those who have done here what is well-pleasing in His sight.
	</p>
<p><strong> for ever and ever. Amen.</strong> The expression, as will be seen from the literal rendering, is very strong, and implies the endlessness of the glory which belongs, and should be ascribed, unto God.
