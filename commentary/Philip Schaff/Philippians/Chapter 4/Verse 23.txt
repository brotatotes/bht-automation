Philippians 4:23.  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. This is the form of the closing benediction according to the oldest authorities. Such changes from the primitive text have been introduced by a desire to bring all the closing benedictions as nearly as possible into one form. Probably at first no more was done than to write the different form on the margin. After this, some future scribe, having a text and margin, considered it best to bring all into the same shape.
