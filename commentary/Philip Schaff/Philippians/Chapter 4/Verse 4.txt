<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+4:4">Philippians 4:4</span>. <strong> Rejoice in the Lord alway. </strong> The apostle now takes up the thread of his thoughts from chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+3:1">Philippians 3:1</span>. Two digressions on Judaizers and on those who mind earthly things have intervened, but he now turns back to his chief theme of ‘joy in the Lord.’
	</p>
<p><strong> again I will say, Rejoice.</strong> When we reflect that the Epistle was written from his prison, we may judge of the comfort which the apostle found in Christ, and may see why he is ready to count all things loss for Him who fills his heart with such unspeakable rejoicing.
