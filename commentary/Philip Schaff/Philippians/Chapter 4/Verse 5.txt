Philippians 4:5.  Let your forbearance be known unto all men. Let them see that you behave with gentleness even in all the opposition of your adversaries. Thus shall they be taught that there is a power in Christianity, and be led to glorify your Master. The apostle does not encourage to any parade or ostentation of gentleness, but such a life as shall be in all its parts marked by this virtue, so that men at all times may recognise how the Christian differs from others.
	 the Lord is at hand. The special Christian watchword in the early days of the faith, and there can be no doubt that there was a widespread expectation of the immediate coming of Christ. The words are meant first as an encouragement to those who had much to suffer, that they should not faint, for the Deliverer was near; next for a warning, that none should relax, lest Christ should come, and those who were called by His name should be found not watchful.
