Philippians 4:8.  Finally,  brethren. He lingers in the conclusion as though the writing of his letter in some degree soothed his longing for them.
	 whatsoever things are true.  Not merely in words only, but in thoughts and actions.
	 whatsoever things are honourable.  Such as make men esteemed and revered by those with whom they live.
	 whatsoever things are just.  Actions upright in all respects, whether concerning ourselves or others.
	 whatsoever things are pure.  Unspotted chasteness in the whole behaviour.
	 whatsoever things are lovely. Which win favour from those among whom they are done; which gather men friends.
	 whatsoever things are of good report.  Well spoken of among men, and so bringing a good name.
	 if there be any virtue.  He adds this, that he may leave nothing out of his enumeration, ‘whatever virtue there be.’
	 and if there be any praise.  The   praise is a consequence of the virtue. He does not intend that the Philippians should follow after all   that the carnal world might praise, but only what is praised because it is virtuous.
	 think on these things.  The word is not, as will be seen from the notes, the common word for ‘think,’ but indicates the making up of a reckoning. He has been giving them a long list of virtues as constituents of the Christian character, and the employment of this word may have been suggested by the thought that they must add virtue after virtue, and so try to make the reckoning as complete as they could. Count up these things, he would say, for yourselves, and as you do so, try to cultivate the whole.
