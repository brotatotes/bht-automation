Philippians 4:9.  The things which ye both learned, and received, and heard, and saw in me, these things do.  Knowing how much more telling example often is than precept, the apostle points to his own teaching and life as they had known them. At first they had been scholars learning from him; after that, they became fellow workers and brethren, and were entrusted with a   share of the duties of the church, and as he had received from the Lord, so they had received from him; beside which they were daily witnesses of his words and works, and to these he refers them as their practical standard.
	 and the God of peace shall be with you.  This he says speaking out of the depths of his own experience. He knows that his own pursuit of the high standard which he is setting before the Philippians has brought him peace, even amid the greatest afflictions, through the indwelling presence of God. And his constant feeling of joy in the Lord, even in his present chains, is a telling evidence that the God of peace is with him.
