 He rejoices ever their Liberality,  because it is a proof of the fruits of their Faith,  10-20.
	Now the apostle, before he closes his letter, turns once again to personal matters. He is rejoiced that they have once more manifested their care for him; not that they were remiss, but they had no fitting time or mode to show their care. Nor does he speak of this matter out of want, for his life has taught him to be content with little, and in the strength vouchsafed to him, he can go through every trial. But that they should share his affliction by ministering to it, was well, and in accordance with their former conduct towards him, which was unique among the churches. Yet the gift which they send is not what he specially desires, but the fruit, the increase in Christian love, to which such a gift bears witness. And now, says he, I have everything, and your gift is made not to me only, but to God, who will supply of His grace all your needs. Let Him therefore ever be glorified.
