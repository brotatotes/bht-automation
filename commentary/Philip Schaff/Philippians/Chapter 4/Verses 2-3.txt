<p>We find from the history of the Acts of the Apostles that women were conspicuous among the first members of the Philippian Church. Lydiaâ€™s house was the home of the missionaries. Women still were among their zealous members, but between some of them there had arisen a difference of feeling, and St. Paul urges union on two of these by name, and begs his fellow-labourers in the Gospel who are in Philippi to help on the consummation of peace and love among the sisters in the church.
