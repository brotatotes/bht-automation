<p><em> How to be ready for the coming of the Lord, </em> 4-7.
	</p>
<p>Turning from special exhortation, St. Paul gives some general precepts to the whole church. In these he exhorts to a religious joy, and this should be accompanied with a kind and forbearing spirit, which all men should recognise as specially Christian. Then all over-anxiety in worldly affairs should be laid aside, and all wants brought to God in earnest supplication. Thus would their hearts and thoughts be kept through Christ in holy peace, passing all that man can think or tell.
