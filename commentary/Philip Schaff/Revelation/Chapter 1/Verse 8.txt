<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+1:8">Revelation 1:8</span>. This conclusion is strengthened by the words of the eighth verse, in which the emphasis lies upon the <strong> Almighty,</strong> thus bringing into prominence that all-powerful might in which Jesus goes forth to be victorious over His enemies. It is Christ, ‘the Lord,’ who speaks, and who says that He is the <strong> Alpha and the Omega;</strong> that He is God (for we are not to read the two words Lord God together); that He is he <strong> which is, and which was, and which is to come;</strong> and that all culminates in His title <strong> the Almighty.</strong> To suppose that the words are spoken by the Father is to introduce a thought not strictly corresponding to what precedes. The unity of the whole passage is only preserved by ascribing them to the exalted and glorified Redeemer. The words are thus highly important as witnessing to the true Divinity of Christ, and in particular to His possessing the same eternity as the Almighty.

<p>Thus, in the assurance that the Lord will come in His might for the accomplishment of His plans, the Seer is prepared to enter upon a description of the visions which he had enjoyed.
