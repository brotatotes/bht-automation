Revelation 10:4. The thunders must not only have been in themselves intelligible, but they must have been understood by the Seer. Hence, thinking probably of the command in chap. Revelation 1:11, he was about to write them.  A voice out of heaven,  however, was heard  saying, Seal the things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. We are not to suppose that the object of this command was to keep the contents of the thunders for ever concealed. These contents, we have seen, relate to the fortunes of Christâ€™s Church and people. But they learn only by experience. They must pass through trials, whatever they may be, before darkness is dispelled and light in its full brightness shines around them (comp. John 2:22; John 12:16).
