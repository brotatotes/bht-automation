Revelation 11:12. Nor that alone. They hear a voice summoning them to ascend into heaven in the presence of the same beholders, and they obey.  They went up into heaven in the cloud, not in the clouds, or simply in a cloud; but in a distinct and definite cloud, that of the angel of chap. Revelation 10:1, or of Christ in chap. Revelation 14:14-16; and their triumph was witnessed by those who killed them.
