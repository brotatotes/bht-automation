Revelation 11:14.  The second woe is past, behold the third woe cometh quickly. At chap. Revelation 8:13 mention was made of three Woes. At chap. Revelation 9:12 the first Woe was said to be past. The sixth trumpet then sounded and was continued to chap. Revelation 9:21. From chap. Revelation 10:1 to chap. Revelation 11:13 we have had consolatory visions, and now in the verse before us the second Woe is declared to be past. The object of the verse, therefore, is to remind us of what we might perhaps have forgotten, that the second woe had closed some time before, but that nothing shall now interrupt the sounding of the seventh trumpet on the coming of the third Woe, he triumph of the Church. In the meantime it is enough to say that the triumph of the Church implies the overthrow of her enemies, and that the greater and more glorious the one the more disastrous and humiliating must be the other. Particulars in these verses still more strikingly illustrating the character of a Woe will be noticed as we proceed with the exposition.
