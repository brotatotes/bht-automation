<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15">Revelation 11:15</span>. It is difficult to say to whom the <strong> great voices</strong> spoken of in this verse belong. They can hardly come from angels, or from the four living creatures, or indeed from any created thing. They seem rather a poetic method of giving expression to the fact that those counsels of the Almighty which had been long since taken, but which had been hitherto concealed from every eye but that of faith, were about to go into open execution. The words uttered by the voices are, <strong> The kingdom of the world is become the possession of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever.</strong> The word ‘kingdom’ used here is to be understood in the sense of ‘dominion over,’ and not in that of all the kingdoms of the world united into one. This dominion is celebrated as given to the Father in the Son and to the Son in the Father; and it shall be theirs for ever and ever, all its enemies being completely overthrown.
