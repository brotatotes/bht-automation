<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+11:17">Revelation 11:17</span>. Contains the first part of their song of praise and thanksgiving. In reading, a comma is to be placed after the word <strong> Lord,</strong> which presents us with the name of Him who has thus triumphed, and brought the troubles of His Church to an end. The name ‘Lord’ is then followed by three appellations as at chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+4:8">Revelation 4:8</span>, first. <strong> God; </strong> secondly, <strong> the Almighty;</strong> thirdly, <strong> which art and which wast,</strong> the third clause usually belonging to this last appellative, ‘which is to come,’ being left out because no longer needed: the Lord is come. This part of the song of praise deals with the general statement that the Lord has <strong> taken</strong> to Him His <strong> great power.</strong> That power had indeed been always His, but for a time He had permitted His enemies to contend against it. He is to permit this no longer.
