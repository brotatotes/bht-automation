Revelation 11:3. The voice is continued, and the use of the word my connected with the  two witnesses  seems to indicate that it is the Lord who speaks, though in all probability by means of the ‘strong angel’ mentioned in chap. Revelation 10:1. The witnesses receive both the words of their prophecy and the power to utter them. The duty of ‘prophesying’ laid upon them is that of proclaiming the truth of God for the instruction or warning of men; while the clothing  with sackcloth, a rough cloth of goats ‘or of camels’ hair, reminds us of Elijah and the Baptist (2 Kings 1:8; Matthew 3:4), and indicates the sufferings which the witnesses shall endure in delivering their message (2 Kings 19:1; Psalms 30:11; Isaiah 22:12).
