Revelation 11:5.  if    any man desireth to hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devonreth their enemies. There can be no doubt that the allusion is to 2 Kings 1:10; 2 Kings 1:12, although literal fire may not be thought of, but rather those ‘words’ of the Lord in the mouth of His prophet of which it is said, ‘I will make them fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them’ (Jeremiah 5:14). In the last half of the verse we have the  lex talionis,  judgment returning in kind upon the oppressors of the just. These oppressors hurt to the extent of killing, just as the Jews ‘went about to kill Jesus’ in the days of His flesh. As a consequence,  in this manner must they be killed.
