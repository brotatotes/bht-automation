<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+11:7">Revelation 11:7</span>. That the witnesses have <strong> a testimony </strong> to deliver has already appeared from the words ‘they shall prophesy’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+11:3">Revelation 11:3</span>, and from their coming before us in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+11:4">Revelation 11:4</span> as fruit-bearing and light-giving. This work they shall accomplish: this witness they shall ‘finish’ in the spirit of Him who cried upon the cross, ‘It is finished:’ and at that moment, as in His case so in theirs, their opponents shall seem to have the victory.

<p><strong> The beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.</strong> This ‘beast’ is without doubt that of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8">Revelation 17:8</span>, here mentioned by anticipation; and he shall act as the beast in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="da+7:21">Daniel 7:21</span>.
