Revelation 11:7. That the witnesses have  a testimony  to deliver has already appeared from the words ‘they shall prophesy’ in Revelation 11:3, and from their coming before us in Revelation 11:4 as fruit-bearing and light-giving. This work they shall accomplish: this witness they shall ‘finish’ in the spirit of Him who cried upon the cross, ‘It is finished:’ and at that moment, as in His case so in theirs, their opponents shall seem to have the victory.
	 The beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them. This ‘beast’ is without doubt that of Revelation 13:1 and Revelation 17:8, here mentioned by anticipation; and he shall act as the beast in Daniel 7:21.
