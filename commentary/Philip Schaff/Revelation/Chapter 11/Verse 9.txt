Revelation 11:9. The spectators mentioned in this verse come from the whole world in its fourfold designation of  peoples and tribes and tongues and nations. All look upon the ‘dead body’ of the witnesses without commiseration for the miserable state in which it lies. This they do for three days and a half, not literal days but, according to the analogy of three and a half years, a broken, incomplete, and probably short period. That during this period the world  suffers not their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb heightens the picture of contempt and injury (comp. Genesis 23:4; Isaiah 14:19-20).
