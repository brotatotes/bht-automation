Revelation 12:1.  And there appeared a great sign in heaven. The ‘sign’ consists of three particulars, and the first of these is again divided into three parts, mention of which occupies the remainder of this verse,  a woman arrayed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars. The immense body of light constituting the sun is her garment. The moon, the second of the light-giving bodies of heaven, is under her feet, yet certainly not in token of subjection, an idea entirely out of keeping with the position immediately afterwards assigned to the twelve stars. Nor does it seem possible to behold in ‘the moon’ a representation of the Law, or of the legal Israel, as the foundation of the Christian Church. The Church is founded not on the Law but on Christ (1 Corinthians 3:11). In order to ascertain the meaning we must take sun, moon, and stars together; and, when we do so, the idea appears to be that the woman is completely enveloped in light. This is not secured by the simple mention of the sun as her garment, for that only wraps her body round from the shoulders to the feet. The other bodies of light which shine in heaven are therefore called into requisition. By means of them she has light around, beneath, and above her. The stars are not set as jewels in her crown. They  are  her crown, a crown of victory. The woman is a conqueror, and twelve is the number of the Church. (For the whole description comp. Song of Solomon 6:10; Revelation 1:16; Revelation 21:12; Revelation 21:14.)
