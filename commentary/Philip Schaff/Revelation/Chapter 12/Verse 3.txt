Revelation 12:3.  And there appeared another sign in heaven. In every respect this second sign is the counterpart or opposite of the first; and, like it, it is described in three particulars. The first has relation to the object seen.
	 And behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems. The dragon is ‘great’ in power. He is ‘red’ with the colour of blood because he kills men (chap. Revelation 17:3; Revelation 17:6; John 8:44; 1 John 3:12). He has ‘seven heads and ten horns,’ a figure by which is indicated his rule over all the kingdoms of this world  as well as the force with which he rules them. The ‘diadems,’ it may be further noticed, are not crowns like that of the woman. They are rather bands or fillets round the head. Even in the greatest lustre of his might the dragon is not a conqueror.
