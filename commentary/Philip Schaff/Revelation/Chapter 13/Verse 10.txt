<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+13:10">Revelation 13:10</span>. <strong> If any one is for captivity, into captivity he goeth: if any one shall kill with the sword, with the sword must he be killed. </strong> In a climax of two clauses consolation is afforded to the righteous amidst all their trials. There is a <em> lex talionis </em> in the dealings of God. They who lead His people into captivity, they who kill them with the sword, shall experience a similar fate.
	</p>
<p><strong> Here is the patience and the faith of the saints. </strong> For surely there is enough to nerve our patience and to stimulate our faith in the thought that ‘God judgeth in the earth,’ and that it is a righteous thing with Him ‘to recompense tribulation’ to them that trouble His people.
