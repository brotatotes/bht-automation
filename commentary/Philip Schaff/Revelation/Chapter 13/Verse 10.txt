Revelation 13:10.  If any one is for captivity, into captivity he goeth: if any one shall kill with the sword, with the sword must he be killed.  In a climax of two clauses consolation is afforded to the righteous amidst all their trials. There is a  lex talionis  in the dealings of God. They who lead His people into captivity, they who kill them with the sword, shall experience a similar fate.
	 Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.  For surely there is enough to nerve our patience and to stimulate our faith in the thought that ‘God judgeth in the earth,’ and that it is a righteous thing with Him ‘to recompense tribulation’ to them that trouble His people.
