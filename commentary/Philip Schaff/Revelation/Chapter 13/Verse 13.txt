Revelation 13:13.  And he doeth great signs that he should even make fire to come down out of heaven into the earth before men. The ‘great signs’ are again a symbol of what is done  by false prophetical and priestly  power. The ‘fire out of heaven’ is explained by the function of this beast. He is to direct men to the worship of the first beast in whom the Satanic power of the dragon is personified. As therefore Christ, in whom the power of God is personified, is preceded by Elias, who is to direct men’s eyes to Him, so the first beast has in the second his Elias, who travesties the miracle of the ancient prophet (2 Kings 1:10-12).
