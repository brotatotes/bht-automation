<p><strong> Saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which hath the stroke of the sword, and rose to life.</strong> The difficult expression ‘image of the beast’ occurs ten times in the Apocalypse, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+13:14-15">Revelation 13:14-15</span> (thrice), <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:9">Revelation 14:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:11">Revelation 14:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+15:2">Revelation 15:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+16:2">Revelation 16:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:20">Revelation 19:20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4">Revelation 20:4</span>. It is to be explained by the help of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:26">Genesis 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>; 1Co 11:7 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:49">1 Corinthians 15:49</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:10">Colossians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>, Comparing these passages, the thought of the Seer appears to be as follows First, we have God, the Son the true ‘image’ of God, and man ‘renewed’ in the Son ‘after the image of Him that created him.’ Secondly, we have the first beast or the world-power in all the ungodliness of its spirit, that spirit supposed to be incarnated in its ‘image,’ and men so created after that image that they may be said to be ‘of their father the devil’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>). The second beast or the false prophet will then stand in the same relation to the first beast and men as that in which Christ the true prophet stands to God and men. It may indeed be said that, were this view correct, we ought to read that men <em> are made </em> after the image of the beast, whereas what is really said is that they <em> ‘make’ </em> the image. But, according to the constant teaching of St. John, men who are made make. They love the darkness; they choose the evil; their will is active not passive in the matter. There is no ground for the idea that in the image made to the beast we have an allusion to those statues of the Roman Emperors which some of the basest of them set up for worship. ‘Image’ in its Scripture sense expresses something living. It would be far more natural to seek the ‘image’ in the Emperors themselves.
