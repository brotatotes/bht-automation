Revelation 13:5.  And there was given him a month speaking great things and blasphemies. This is the first of three things spoken of (Revelation 13:5-7) as ‘given,’  i.e  given by God to whom in its utmost might the beast is subject. The description is taken from Daniel 8:8; Daniel 8:20; Daniel 8:25, where similar language is used of the ‘Little Horn.’ The second thing ‘given’ is a  uthority to work forty and two months. For the time here specified see on chap. Revelation 11:2.
