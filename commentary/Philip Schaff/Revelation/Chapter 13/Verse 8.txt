<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+13:8">Revelation 13:8</span>. <strong> And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him.</strong> These dwellers upon the earth are in contrast with those who ‘tabernacle in heaven.’ They are the ungodly as distinguished from the godly; and again they are not confined to the Roman Empire, but include all who anywhere worship the beast.

<p><strong> Every one whose name hath not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lamb that hath been slain.</strong> The plural of the first clause of the verse, ‘all,’ passes into the singular of the second clause, those referred to being now looked at individually (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:2">John 17:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:37">John 6:37</span>). The connection of the last clause is doubtful. It may be joined, as in the Authorised Version, with the ‘Lamb that hath been slain;’ but chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8">Revelation 17:8</span> seems to determine in favour of connecting it with the word ‘written.’ Besides which, the clause is less appropriate to the slaying of the Lamb, <em> an act </em> which took place in time, than to those counsels of the Almighty which are from eternity.
