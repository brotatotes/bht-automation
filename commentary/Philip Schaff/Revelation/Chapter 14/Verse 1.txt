<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1">Revelation 14:1</span>. <strong> First the Lamb</strong> is seen <strong> standing on the mount Sion.</strong> It is the same Lamb that we have already met with at chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>, the once crucified, but now risen and glorified, Lord. The ‘mount Sion’ is neither the literal Sion at Jerusalem, nor the Christian Church, but simply the most appropriate place for the people of God to occupy, the holy mount, the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High. The scene of preservation is not heaven but earth.

<p><strong> And with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his name and the name of his Father written on their fore-heads.</strong> These are the sealed of chap. 7, not one lost. True, they are not spoken of as the ‘sealed.’ In chap. 7 they were so described, for their preservation was there the prominent thought. Now that they have been preserved and admitted as priests within the veil, our attention may be directed to the contents of the seal. These are in part at least it is not necessary to think wholly the ‘name’ which belongs at once to the Father and to the Lamb, the name Lord. St. John, as his manner is, is loftier than St. Paul, who says, ‘Ye are the Lord’s’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:8">Romans 14:8</span>).
