Revelation 14:10.  He also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, the poured out unmingled wine in the cup of his anger. The punishment of such is now described in four particulars, the number four being perhaps taken because it is the ungodly world with which we are dealing, and because it is a  lex talionis  that is illustrated. The first of the four particulars corresponds to Revelation 14:8, and shows that we have before us essentially the same spirit as that there referred to. The wine is said (literally) to be ‘mingled unmingled;’ but there is no play upon the words, for, owing to the practice of the ancients to mingle water with wine, the verb to mingle had come to be used in the simple sense of pouring out. Enough that the wine of the wrath of God is now ‘unmingled;’ the day of grace is past.
	 And he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone before the angels and before the Lamb. The second of the four particulars presents us with the final punishment of hell (comp. chaps. Revelation 19:20, Revelation 20:10, Revelation 21:8; Genesis 19:24).
