<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:11">Revelation 14:11</span>. <strong> And the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever.</strong> The third of the four particulars of their miserable doom, which is unto ages of ages, that is, ‘for ever.’
	</p>
<p><strong> And they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.</strong> This is the fourth and last particular in the delineation of their misery, which is not only everlasting, but uninterrupted while it lasts. Can we fail to mark the contrast to the ‘no rest day nor night’ of the four living creatures in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+4:8">Revelation 4:8</span>? In their ‘receiving’ the mark it is implied that there is voluntary action on the part of the followers of the beast. The first three angels have now fulfilled their message and, before we come to the Judge Himself, there is a pause. Two sayings are introduced.
