<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:12">Revelation 14:12</span>. <strong> Here is the patience of the saints, they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. </strong> The first of the two sayings is an encouragement to the faithful afforded by the fact that God will execute His judgments upon the ungodly in the way which has been described (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+13:10">Revelation 13:10</span>). We have in this a further proof that the whole proclamation of the three angels has been one of judgment, not of mercy, or of judgment and mercy combined. The construction of the two clauses is important, as there can be no doubt that the second contains a fuller description of the ‘saints’ mentioned in the first (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4">Revelation 20:4</span>).
