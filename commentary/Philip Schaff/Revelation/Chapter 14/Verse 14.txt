<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:14">Revelation 14:14</span>. It has been already stated that the chapter now under consideration divides itself into seven parts, the first three introducing to us three angels (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1-13">Revelation 14:1-13</span>), the last three doing the same (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:17-20">Revelation 14:17-20</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:14-16">Revelation 14:14-16</span> thus constitute the fourth or leading passage of the seven. It is the centre of the whole chapter, and its very position thus prepares us for the transition that we make in it from angels to the Lord Himself. What is first seen is <strong> a white cloud,</strong> the cloud upon which Jesus is elsewhere represented as coming in order to wind up the history of the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:64">Matthew 26:64</span>). Upon this cloud is seen <strong> one sitting like unto a Son of man, </strong> a description which can leave no doubt upon the mind that it is the Lord (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+1:13">Revelation 1:13</span>). Nor is it in any way inconsistent with this that He who sits upon the cloud receives a commission from an angel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:14">Revelation 14:14</span>). That angel delivers a message from God (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13-14">Daniel 7:13-14</span>). The ‘Son of man’ wears a crown of victory. He went out to conquer (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+6:2">Revelation 6:2</span>): He now returns as a conqueror. The sickle is for reaping.
