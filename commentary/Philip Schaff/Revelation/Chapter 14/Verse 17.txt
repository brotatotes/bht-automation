<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:17">Revelation 14:17</span>. In this verse the second of the second group of three angels appears. He also has a sharp sickle like that of the Person mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:14">Revelation 14:14</span>. But he is not on that account to be identified with Him he only carries out His will. The sickle too is to be used for another purpose, there for reaping, here for gathering the vintage.
