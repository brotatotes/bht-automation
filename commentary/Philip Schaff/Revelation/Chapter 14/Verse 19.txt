Not merely the grapes but the <strong> vine of the earth</strong> itself is gathered, the vine being wholly rooted out according to the words of the Lord, ‘Every plant which My Heavenly Father planted not shall be rooted up’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:13">Matthew 15:13</span>).
