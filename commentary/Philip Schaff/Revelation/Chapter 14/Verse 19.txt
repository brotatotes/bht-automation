Revelation 14:19. The vintage is described. Not merely the grapes but the  vine of the earth itself is gathered, the vine being wholly rooted out according to the words of the Lord, ‘Every plant which My Heavenly Father planted not shall be rooted up’ (Matthew 15:13). After this the vine is cast into  the great winepress of the wrath of God.
