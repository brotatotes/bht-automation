<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:3">Revelation 14:3</span>. The song referred to is not said to be sung by the 144,000, and perhaps we ought to think simply of a great body of praise going up before the throne. <strong> And no one could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand, even they that had been purchased out of the earth. </strong> They are described as ‘purchased out of the earth,’ a designation which, like that of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:4">Revelation 14:4</span>, ‘from among men,’ must be accepted in a general sense, there being nothing to suggest the idea of Judaism alone. The word ‘earth’ rather leads us to the thought of our natural condition as sons of Adam (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:19">Genesis 3:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:47">1 Corinthians 15:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:49">1 Corinthians 15:49</span>).
