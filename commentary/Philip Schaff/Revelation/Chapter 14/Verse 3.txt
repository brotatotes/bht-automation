Revelation 14:3. The song referred to is not said to be sung by the 144,000, and perhaps we ought to think simply of a great body of praise going up before the throne.  And no one could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand, even they that had been purchased out of the earth.  They are described as ‘purchased out of the earth,’ a designation which, like that of Revelation 14:4, ‘from among men,’ must be accepted in a general sense, there being nothing to suggest the idea of Judaism alone. The word ‘earth’ rather leads us to the thought of our natural condition as sons of Adam (Genesis 3:19; 1 Corinthians 15:47; 1 Corinthians 15:49).
