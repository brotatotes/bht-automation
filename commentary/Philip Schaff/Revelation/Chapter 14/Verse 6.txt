Revelation 14:6. The angel referred to in this verse cannot be reckoned  another with reference to any angels previously mentioned, for in Revelation 14:8-9 we read of the ‘second’ and ‘third’ angel by whom he is followed, thus making this the first. He is simply therefore ‘another,’ because he introduces a new series of angels. He flies  in mid-heaven (comp. Revelation 8:13), for his voice is to reach over the whole earth. He has  an eternal gospel to proclaim, usually understood as the Gospel of glad tidings now to be proclaimed for the last time to a sinful world. If, however, this be the meaning, it seems unaccountable that the article should be omitted. The word ‘Gospel’ must therefore be understood in the same sense as ‘prophesying’ in chap. Revelation 10:11.
	Revelation 14:7, which gives the proclamation, confirms this view; the description in Revelation 14:6 of those to whom it is made does so too; and the very preposition following the verb in the original implies something peculiar in the mode in which the tidings are proclaimed. It is not ‘the eternal Gospel’ of Christ, then, that is spoken of, but the condemnation which alone remains for those by whom that Gospel has been despised and rejected (comp. on chap. Revelation 15:6). These persons are described in a twofold manner. First, they sit (not ‘dwell’)  on the earth. The word ‘sit’ may appear unsuitable to the idiom of the English language, but it ought to be employed, as alone bringing out the meaning of the original. Not the inhabitants of the earth in general are alluded to, but those only who have made the earth their  throne.  Secondly, they are gathered together in the four terms which denote universality,  every nation and tribe and tongue and people.
