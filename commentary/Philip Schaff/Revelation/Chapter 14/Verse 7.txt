The angel now utters his cry, <strong> Fear God, and give glory to him, because the hour of his judgment is come.</strong> The ‘fear’ and the ‘giving glory’ spoken of are those of unbelief and hardness of heart (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+11:13">Revelation 11:13</span>). On the word ‘hour’ comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="da+4:33">Daniel 4:33</span>. There is no ‘great era of Christian missions’ here.
