Revelation 14:7. The angel now utters his cry,  Fear God, and give glory to him, because the hour of his judgment is come. The ‘fear’ and the ‘giving glory’ spoken of are those of unbelief and hardness of heart (comp. chap. Revelation 11:13). On the word ‘hour’ comp. Daniel 4:33. There is no ‘great era of Christian missions’ here.
	 And worship him that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters. For the ‘worshipping’ of God spoken of comp. on chap. Revelation 15:4.
