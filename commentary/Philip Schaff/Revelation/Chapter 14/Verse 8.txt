<p><strong> Saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, which hath made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</strong> The proclamation is simply anticipatory of what is to be more fully described hereafter. Till we come, therefore, to that description (chap. 18) it may be well to defer inquiry into the meaning of the word ‘Babylon.’ In her ungodly influence Babylon is spoken of as making ‘all the nations to drink,’ etc. (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:7">Jeremiah 51:7</span>). A third angel follows.
