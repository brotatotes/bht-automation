<p>The visions contained in these verses are of the same preparatory character as the preceding vision. The structure of the passage is remarkable. It will be observed that it consists of seven parts, each part except the fourth, which in a series of seven is always the central and most important, being introduced by an angel (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:6">Revelation 14:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8-9">Revelation 14:8-9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:15">Revelation 14:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:17-18">Revelation 14:17-18</span>). In the fourth part, at <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:14">Revelation 14:14</span>, we have the central figure of the movement, described exactly as in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+1:13">Revelation 1:13</span>, ‘one like unto a Son of man.’
