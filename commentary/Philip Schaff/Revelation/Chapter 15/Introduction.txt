This chapter is introductory (like chaps. 12, 13, and 14) to the final outpouring of the Almighty’s wrath upon the enemies of His Church. In chaps. 12 and 13 we had these enemies presented to us; in chap. 14 we had the assurance that, formidable as they were, they should neither be able to hurt the righteous nor to protect the wicked. In chap. 15 the last ministers of the Almighty’s vengeance are introduced, and we are invited to listen to the song with which they are sent forth upon their mission. The series of the Bowls opens with two visions, the first in Revelation 15:2-4, the second in Revelation 15:5-8, of this chapter. The Seals were introduced by no vision immediately connected with them: the Trumpets were introduced by one vision (chap. Revelation 8:1-5). Two visions introduce the Bowls, and thus again illustrate the climactic character of this book.
