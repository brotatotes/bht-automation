<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+15:1">Revelation 15:1</span>. The <strong> angels</strong> spoken of have <strong> seven plagues which are the last;</strong> and the reason is assigned why they are so named, for in them <strong> is finished the wrath of God.</strong> Godâ€™s last and most terrible judgments are at hand.
