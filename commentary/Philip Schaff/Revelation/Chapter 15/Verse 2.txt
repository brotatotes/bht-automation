<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+15:2">Revelation 15:2</span>. The next thing seen is <strong> a glassy sea mingled with fire.</strong> There can be no reason to doubt that this is the sea already spoken of at chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+4:6">Revelation 4:6</span>. The difference is, that it is now ‘mingled with fire,’ the same fire as that of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:18">Revelation 14:18</span>, the fire of judgment (comp. on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+4:6">Revelation 4:6</span>).

<p>Those that occupy this sea are next described as they that <strong> come victorious out of the beast, and out of his image, and out of the number of his name,</strong> words in which the remarkable use of the preposition ‘out of’ is well worthy of notice (comp. on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:15">John 17:15</span>). In the persons referred to we must include all Christians of all times who have been victorious over the three things mentioned. There is nothing to suggest the thought of a mere selection from that number.

<p><strong> For</strong> <strong> the harps of God</strong> which they hold in their hands see chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+5:8">Revelation 5:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:2">Revelation 14:2</span>.
