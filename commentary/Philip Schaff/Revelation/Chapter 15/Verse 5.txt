Revelation 15:5.  And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of witness in heaven was opened. When at chap. Revelation 11:19 the ‘temple of God that is in heaven’ was opened there was seen ‘the ark of the covenant’ reminding of mercy here the same ark is seen, but now it is in ‘the tabernacle of witness,’  i.e  in the tabernacle containing the tables of the law by which God witnessed against Israel. At present, therefore, there is only judgment in view, and God is to take immediate part in it.
