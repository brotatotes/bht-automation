<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+15:7">Revelation 15:7</span>. <strong> One of the living creatures</strong> next gives to the seven angels <strong> seven golden bowls.</strong> These living creatures, it will be remembered, are the representatives of redeemed creation, so that in the action here described the redeemed appear as giving the summons for the execution of judgment upon their enemies. It will be noticed that the Greek word rendered ‘vials’ in the Authorised Version we translate, with the Revised Version, ‘bowls.’ The objects so designated were not vials but those sacred bowls, rather broad than deep, in which the incense, lighted by coals from the brazen altar, was offered on the golden altar within the sanctuary. They are called ‘basons’ in the Old Testament. They are thus much better adapted than vials to any sudden and terrible outpouring of the wrath of God.
