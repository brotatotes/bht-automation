<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+15:8">Revelation 15:8</span>. <strong> And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power. </strong> This smoke is no smoke of incense, nor is it simply the thick cloud of the majesty of God. It is the smoke by which He is surrounded as the righteous Lawgiver, that which proceeds from the fire of His wrath. The figure seems to be derived from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+40:34-35">Exodus 40:34-35</span>.

<p><strong> And no one was able to enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished.</strong> The meaning of these words is perhaps best to be ascertained by comparing them with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:21">Exodus 19:21</span>. God cannot be approached at the moment when He is revealing Himself in all the terrors of His indignation.
