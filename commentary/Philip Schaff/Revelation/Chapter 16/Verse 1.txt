The voice heard is that of God, for He alone was in the temple (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+15:8">Revelation 15:8</span>); and it comes from the innermost shrine.

He takes His own cause in hand. The <strong> earth</strong> is to be distinguished from the ‘sea’ (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+16:3">Revelation 16:3</span>).
