Revelation 16:1. The voice heard is that of God, for He alone was in the temple (chap. Revelation 15:8); and it comes from the innermost shrine. Nothing of this kind had been said at the opening of the trumpets (chap. Revelation 8:7); and the distinction is important, for it shows us that it is not now the people of God who continue the conflict, but God Himself who acts directly for them. He takes His own cause in hand. The  earth is to be distinguished from the ‘sea’ (comp. Revelation 16:3).
