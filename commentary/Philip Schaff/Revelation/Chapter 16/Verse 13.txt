<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+16:13">Revelation 16:13</span>. The <strong> dragon, </strong> the <strong> beast,</strong> and the <strong> false prophet</strong> are again before us. They are the three great enemies of the people of God who have already been described; although here we have for the first time the second beast of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+13:11">Revelation 13:11</span> spoken of as the ‘false prophet,’ a designation afterwards applied to it in chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:20">Revelation 19:20</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:10">Revelation 20:10</span>. The point to be chiefly noticed is that <em> all </em> the great enemies of God’s people are gathered together. <em> All </em> the demoniacal powers of the world in their united forces are on the stage. </p>
<p><strong> Three unclean spirits as it were frogs.</strong> An unclean spirit comes out of the mouth of each; and the spirits are as ‘frogs,’ unclean, boasting, noisy, offensive animals. There may perhaps be a reference to the frogs of Egypt. The land of Egypt had ‘brought forth frogs in the chambers of their kings’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+105:30">Psalms 105:30</span>) so does this spiritual Egypt.
