Revelation 16:13. The  dragon,  the  beast, and the  false prophet are again before us. They are the three great enemies of the people of God who have already been described; although here we have for the first time the second beast of chap. Revelation 13:11 spoken of as the ‘false prophet,’ a designation afterwards applied to it in chaps. Revelation 19:20 and Revelation 20:10. The point to be chiefly noticed is that  all  the great enemies of God’s people are gathered together.  All  the demoniacal powers of the world in their united forces are on the stage.  Three unclean spirits as it were frogs. An unclean spirit comes out of the mouth of each; and the spirits are as ‘frogs,’ unclean, boasting, noisy, offensive animals. There may perhaps be a reference to the frogs of Egypt. The land of Egypt had ‘brought forth frogs in the chambers of their kings’ (Psalms 105:30) so does this spiritual Egypt.
