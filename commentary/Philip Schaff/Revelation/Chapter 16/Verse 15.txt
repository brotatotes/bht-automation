Revelation 16:15. The wonderful character of the great day of God, and of the issues that belong to it, leads to the interposition of this verse.
	 Behold, I come as a thief. The Lord Himself speaks, not the Seer in His name. The words are those of Matthew 24:1; Matthew 25:1, Mark 13:34, Luke 12:37, and they embrace the thought both of the suddenness of Christâ€™s coming, and of the destruction which it brings with it to the wicked (comp. on chap. Revelation 3:3). In the remaining words of the verse the Seer seems to take up the strain, as he pronounces blessedness upon him who is ready for the events of the day so rapidly approaching. Similar parentheses occur at chaps. Revelation 13:9 and Revelation 14:12.
