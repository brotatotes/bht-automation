<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+16:15">Revelation 16:15</span>. The wonderful character of the great day of God, and of the issues that belong to it, leads to the interposition of this verse.

<p><strong> Behold, I come as a thief.</strong> The Lord Himself speaks, not the Seer in His name. The words are those of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:1">Matthew 24:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:1">Matthew 25:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:34">Mark 13:34</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:37">Luke 12:37</span>, and they embrace the thought both of the suddenness of Christâ€™s coming, and of the destruction which it brings with it to the wicked (comp. on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+3:3">Revelation 3:3</span>). In the remaining words of the verse the Seer seems to take up the strain, as he pronounces blessedness upon him who is ready for the events of the day so rapidly approaching. Similar parentheses occur at chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+13:9">Revelation 13:9</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:12">Revelation 14:12</span>.
