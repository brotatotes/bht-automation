Revelation 16:17.  And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air. The air is the dwelling-place of the powers of darkness, whose head is ‘the prince of the power of the air.’
	 And there came forth a great voice out of the temple, from the throne, saying, It is done.  The voice is from God, and from His very throne. The words are, ‘It is done,’  i.e  all God’s purposes are accomplished: all the plagues are poured out; the end is reached.
