<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+16:17">Revelation 16:17</span>. <strong> And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air.</strong> The air is the dwelling-place of the powers of darkness, whose head is ‘the prince of the power of the air.’
	</p>
<p><strong> And there came forth a great voice out of the temple, from the throne, saying, It is done. </strong> The voice is from God, and from His very throne. The words are, ‘It is done,’ <em> i.e </em> all God’s purposes are accomplished: all the plagues are poured out; the end is reached.
