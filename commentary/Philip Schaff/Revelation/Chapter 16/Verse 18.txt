<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+16:18">Revelation 16:18</span>. <strong> And there were lightnings and voices and thunders.</strong> What follows describing the end seems to be divided into seven particulars, of which this verse contains the first. The ‘lightnings,’ etc., are those which usually accompany the judgments of God. The <strong> earthquake </strong> spoken of in the second half of the verse is the second particular, and its terrors are magnified in language of much sublimity.
