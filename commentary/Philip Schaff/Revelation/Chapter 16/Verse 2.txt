<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+16:2">Revelation 16:2</span>. <strong> The first angel poured out his bowl into the earth.</strong> The whole earth is thought of, and no more only a third part of it as at chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+8:7">Revelation 8:7</span>.

<p><strong> And there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast and which worshipped his image.</strong> The idea of the plague is taken from that of Egypt in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+9:8-12">Exodus 9:8-12</span>, but it cannot be literally understood, for literal interpretation is wholly inapplicable to the sixth bowl, and all the bowls must be interpreted on the same principles.
