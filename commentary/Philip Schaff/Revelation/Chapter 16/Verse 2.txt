Revelation 16:2.  The first angel poured out his bowl into the earth. The whole earth is thought of, and no more only a third part of it as at chap. Revelation 8:7.
	 And there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast and which worshipped his image. The idea of the plague is taken from that of Egypt in Exodus 9:8-12, but it cannot be literally understood, for literal interpretation is wholly inapplicable to the sixth bowl, and all the bowls must be interpreted on the same principles.
