<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+16:21">Revelation 16:21</span>. <strong> And a great hail cometh down as of a talent in weight out of heaven upon men. </strong> The seventh particular, founded upon the thought of the plague of hail on Egypt. Each hailstone is magnified to an enormous extent. Each is a talent, or between 50 and 60 lbs., in weight. The stone descends upon ‘men,’ <em> i.e </em> upon all the inhabiters of the ‘earth’ in its mystical sense, or upon all the ungodly.

<p>The seven particulars of judgment are ended, and we are invited to mark the effect.
	</p>
<p><strong> And men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, because great is the plague of it exceedingly.</strong> The ‘men’ spoken of are again the ungodly, nor is it possible to limit their number to that of those who survive the plague. The writer simply looks away from the fact that those struck with so great a plague die. He thinks of them as still living, but unconverted. They blaspheme; they are hardened; and, when all that ought to convert ‘men’ hardens, we have a proof that the hour of final judgment is come.
