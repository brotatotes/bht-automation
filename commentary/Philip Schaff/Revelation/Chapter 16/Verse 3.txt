<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+16:3">Revelation 16:3</span>. <strong> The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea.</strong> The whole sea, and not merely a part of it as at chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+8:8-9">Revelation 8:8-9</span>, is affected by this plague. The increased potency of the plague is also shown in the description given of the blood, not merely blood, but <strong> blood as of a dead man,</strong> thick, unnatural, offensive to the eye.
	</p>
<p><strong> Every living soul, too, died,</strong> and not merely ‘the third part’ of the creatures that were in the sea. It can hardly be doubted that we have in this bowl a reference to one of the plagues of Egypt (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+7:19">Exodus 7:19</span>). But literal interpretation cannot be thought of.
