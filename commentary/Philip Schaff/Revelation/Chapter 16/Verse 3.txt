Revelation 16:3.  The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea. The whole sea, and not merely a part of it as at chap. Revelation 8:8-9, is affected by this plague. The increased potency of the plague is also shown in the description given of the blood, not merely blood, but  blood as of a dead man, thick, unnatural, offensive to the eye.
	 Every living soul, too, died, and not merely ‘the third part’ of the creatures that were in the sea. It can hardly be doubted that we have in this bowl a reference to one of the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7:19). But literal interpretation cannot be thought of.
