Revelation 16:4.  And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the fountains of the waters, and they became blood. Again we see the increased potency of the third bowl as compared with the third trumpet, chap. Revelation 8:10-11. All rivers, etc., are affected, and they become more than bitter, they become blood.
