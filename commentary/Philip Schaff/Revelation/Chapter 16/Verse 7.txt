Revelation 16:7. Not only is an acknowledgment of the righteousness of God’s judgment given by the ‘waters;’ the martyred saints also respond. The  altar (not as in the Authorised Version ‘another out of the altar’) speaks. It is the altar of chap. Revelation 6:9 beneath which is the blood, that is the lives, of the saints. They who have suffered own that the  judgments of the Almighty upon those who persecuted them even unto death  are true and righteous, conformable to the realities of things and to the demands of perfect righteousness.
