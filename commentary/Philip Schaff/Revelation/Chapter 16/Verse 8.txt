Revelation 16:8.  The fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun, and it was given unto him to scorch men with fire. We have not yet passed into a world different from that with which the previous bowls were connected. ‘Men’ are still plagued, though through the instrumentality of the sun which is used by the angel of judgment for this purpose, the ‘fire’ referred to being the scorching heat of that luminary. As compared with chap. Revelation 8:12 there is again increased intensity of judgment, for the whole sun is affected, and not merely a third part of it; and its scorching heat, which had not there been spoken of, is now particularly noticed.
