Revelation 16:9.  And men were scorched with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God, which hath the power over these plagues, and they repented not to give him glory. The blaspheming is produced not by the last plague alone, but by the four that have been spoken of, ‘plagues’ not plague. The effect is worthy of notice. There is no repentance. Those visited are the followers of the beast. They have chosen their portion; they have hardened themselves; and they are made worse by judgment.
