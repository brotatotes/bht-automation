<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+16:5-6">Revelation 16:5-6</span>. <strong> And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Thou art righteous, which art, and which wast, the Holy One.</strong> No episode of this kind had intervened at the close of the third trumpet. But at the highest stage of judgment it is fitting that even those who suffer from it should answer that it is right. The answer is given by the ‘angel of the waters,’ not the angel ‘who was set over the waters,’ and surely not the angel who now poured out his bowl upon the waters, but the waters themselves speaking by their angel, and responding to the fact that the judgment which they have incurred is just. The ascription of praise is to God as ‘righteous,’ and it will be observed that He is described in three particulars; first, ‘which art,’ secondly, ‘which wast,’ thirdly, ‘the Holy One.’ ‘Which art to come’ can be no longer used, for God is come (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+11:17">Revelation 11:17</span>). The particular method of judgment is also commended. It is again the <em> lex talionis; </em> those who had poured out blood shall drink blood.
