<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1">Revelation 17:1</span>. One of the seven angels that had the seven bowls speaks to the Seer, saying, <strong> Come hither, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters. </strong> The judgment spoken of, as appears by the word used in the original, is judgment executed, not in process of execution. The harlot is obviously Babylon, but the name is a mystical one (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:5">Revelation 17:5</span>), and the Seer will afterwards more fully explain it. ‘Many waters’ are interpreted by the angel in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:15">Revelation 17:15</span> as ‘peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues, and the fourfold division shows that we have a representation of the <em> whole world. </em> The figure is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:13">Jeremiah 51:13</span>, where Babylon is addressed, ‘O thou that dwellest upon many waters.’ ‘Sitting’ is the emblem of authority and rule, accompanied by the thought of ease (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:6">Revelation 14:6</span>). The term ‘harlot’ points to the fact that this city seduced men from the true God to worldliness and sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:21">Isaiah 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jer+2:20">Jeremiah 2:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:15">Ezekiel 16:15</span>).
