Revelation 17:13.  These have one mind, and they give their power and authority unto the beast. So had it been with the second beast (chap. Revelation 13:12), and so with the harlot (chap. Revelation 17:3; Revelation 17:7). The brute power of the world could of itself effect nothing were it not served by the spiritual forces of the false prophet, and of the harlot, or of the kings who have listened to the harlotâ€™s witcheries.
