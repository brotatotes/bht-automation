<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:14">Revelation 17:14</span>. In this verse the war of the ten kings with the Lamb is described, but it is unnecessary to dwell upon it. It may he noticed that the statement of the last half of the verse is not that of the Authorised Version, that the Lamb shall overcome because they that are with Him are called and chosen and faithful, but that <strong> they that are with him, called, and chosen, and faithful,</strong> shall be partakers of the victory. The Seer now returns to the woman who sat upon the beast.
