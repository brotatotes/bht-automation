Revelation 17:17.  For God gave it into their hearts to do his mind, and to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom unto the beast. This ‘giving’ of authority to the beast we have already met with in Revelation 17:13; and in Revelation 17:12 it has been intimated that the ten kings held their authority from God. Whatever, therefore, they had done in persecuting the saints had been accomplishing Goo’s purpose (comp. Acts 2:23).
	 Until the words of God should be accomplished; until all His purposes should be fulfilled.
