<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:18">Revelation 17:18</span>. <strong> And the woman which thou sawest is the great city which hath a kingdom over the kings of the earth.</strong> That Rome may be here present to the mind of St. John it would be difficult to deny. We have seen that Rome may have been thought of in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:9">Revelation 17:9</span>. But that we are to confine ourselves to Rome, either Papal or pagan or both, or that we are even to think primarily of them, as is done by different classes of Historical interpreters, can hardly be admitted. Rome may be one of the illustrations or exemplifications of what is alluded to, but the idea of the Seer is certainly wider than that of any single city or power of the world. We have yet to inquire what the ‘city,’ the ‘Babylon,’ so referred to, is. In the meantime it must be enough to say that to think of any literal city whatever is to disturb the harmony which ought to mark the interpretation of the whole passage. The city must be some faithless spiritual power which, under the last manifestation of the beast, enters into a league with the world, ministers to it, and lends to its material forces an influence for evil which they would not otherwise possess.
