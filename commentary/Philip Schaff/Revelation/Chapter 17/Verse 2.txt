Revelation 17:2.  With whom the kings of the earth committed fornication. ‘Kings’ are the representatives of all authority; and ‘the earth’ is the guilty world.
	 and they that dwell upon the earth were made drunken with the wine of her fornication. Not the kings only but all ‘the inhabiters of the earth,’ all who belong to the world in its evil sense, have been betrayed by the harlot. The description is again unlimited.
