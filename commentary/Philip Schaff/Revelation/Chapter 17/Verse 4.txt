Revelation 17:4.  And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious atone and pearls. In these words we have a general description of the woman’s royal magnificence (comp chap. Revelation 18:16). ‘Arrayed’ is more than adorned. She has not merely ornaments of gold and precious stones and pearls, so numerous that she sparkles with them; they are thought of as a golden and costly gilding to her (comp. chap. Revelation 2:17).
