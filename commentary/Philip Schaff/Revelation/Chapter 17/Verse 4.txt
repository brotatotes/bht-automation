<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:4">Revelation 17:4</span>. <strong> And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious atone and pearls.</strong> In these words we have a general description of the woman’s royal magnificence (comp chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+18:16">Revelation 18:16</span>). ‘Arrayed’ is more than adorned. She has not merely ornaments of gold and precious stones and pearls, so numerous that she sparkles with them; they are thought of as a golden and costly gilding to her (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:17">Revelation 2:17</span>).
