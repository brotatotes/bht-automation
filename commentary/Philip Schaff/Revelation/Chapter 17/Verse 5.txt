<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:5">Revelation 17:5</span>. <strong> And upon her forehead a name written, Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of the Harlots and of the abominations of the earth.</strong> The word ‘mystery’ may be understood either as a part of the name, or as an intimation of the writer that the name is to be understood symbolically. The latter interpretation is to be preferred. It is hardly likely that the name should openly declare itself to be unreal. For such a use of the word ‘mystery,’ comp. the use of ‘spiritually’ in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+11:8">Revelation 11:8</span>. It is worthy of notice that the word ‘mystery’ occurs only four times in the Apocalypse, three times in connection with the nature or the fate of Babylon (chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+10:7">Revelation 10:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:5">Revelation 17:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:7">Revelation 17:7</span>), and once with the seven churches which represent the Church universal (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20">Revelation 1:20</span>). The name of the harlot is thus limited to what follows. Some would even restrict it still further. According to their view, ‘Babylon the Great’ was alone written upon the harlot’s forehead, and the subsequent description is an explanation of the writer. The name has already met us in its shorter form in chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+16:19">Revelation 16:19</span>.

<p>It is unnecessary, in illustration of this verse to refer to the fact that in the pagan world harlots had their names attached to their foreheads. The usage of the Apocalypse is to speak thus of the adherents both of God and of Satan of God, see chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:17">Revelation 2:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+7:3">Revelation 7:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1">Revelation 14:1</span>; of Satan, chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+13:16">Revelation 13:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:20">Revelation 19:20</span>, etc. More particularly the name thus borne upon the forehead is a parody of the name borne upon the forehead of the high priest (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:17">Revelation 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:36">Exodus 28:36</span>). It declares the person.
