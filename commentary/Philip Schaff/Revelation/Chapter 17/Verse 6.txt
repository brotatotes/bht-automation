<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:6">Revelation 17:6</span>. The description of the ungovernable fierceness of the woman’s spirit is continued. She drinks, and makes herself drunk with the blood of the saints and of the martyrs of Jesus (comp, chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+18:24">Revelation 18:24</span>). Having finished his description the Seer adds, <strong> And when I saw her I wondered with a great wonder.</strong> He is overwhelmed with astonishment at the spectacle, yet not so much probably at the royal magnificence of the woman, as that, being a woman, she should exhibit such tokens of a cruel and bloodthirsty spirit, denying the nature that properly belonged to her.

<p>At this point it might have been well to inquire into the meaning of ‘Babylon’ in these verses, but so much has still to be said of that city that it seems better to delay the inquiry until we have finished the exposition of the whole passage. Upon this point, therefore, we refer to what is said at the end of chap. 18
