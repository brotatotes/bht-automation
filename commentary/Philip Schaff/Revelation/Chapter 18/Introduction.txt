The chapter before us is occupied with the fall of Babylon, and it naturally divides itself into three parts. The first contains the announcement of the cityâ€™s fall (Revelation 18:1-3); the second is a powerful description of amazement and lamentation over her fate, proceeding from all who had been dependent upon her (Revelation 18:4-20); the third points out the completeness and irremediableness of her ruin (Revelation 18:21-24).
