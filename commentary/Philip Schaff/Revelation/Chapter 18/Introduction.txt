<p>The chapter before us is occupied with the fall of Babylon, and it naturally divides itself into three parts. The first contains the announcement of the cityâ€™s fall (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+18:1-3">Revelation 18:1-3</span>); the second is a powerful description of amazement and lamentation over her fate, proceeding from all who had been dependent upon her (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+18:4-20">Revelation 18:4-20</span>); the third points out the completeness and irremediableness of her ruin (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+18:21-24">Revelation 18:21-24</span>).
