<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+18:1">Revelation 18:1</span>. <strong> Another angel appears having great authority; and the earth was lightened with his glory.</strong> These last words are in all probability taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eze+43:2">Ezekiel 43:2</span>, ‘and the earth shined with his glory.’ They illustrate the greatness of his mission, and the manner in which the whole ‘earth’ shall be struck with its glorious accomplishment. As in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+7:2">Revelation 7:2</span> this angel has a closer than ordinary connection with the Lord Himself.
