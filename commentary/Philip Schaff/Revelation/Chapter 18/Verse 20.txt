<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+18:20">Revelation 18:20</span>. The judgment of God upon the guilty city is supposed to have taken place. While it is a source of lamentation to the wicked, it is a joy to the righteous, and they are now summoned to experience that joy.
	</p>
<p><strong> For God hath judged your judgment upon her.</strong> The meaning is that that judgment on the wicked which the righteous have passed is regarded as executed for them by God Himself.
