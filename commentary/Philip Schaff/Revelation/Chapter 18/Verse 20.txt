Revelation 18:20. The judgment of God upon the guilty city is supposed to have taken place. While it is a source of lamentation to the wicked, it is a joy to the righteous, and they are now summoned to experience that joy.
	 For God hath judged your judgment upon her. The meaning is that that judgment on the wicked which the righteous have passed is regarded as executed for them by God Himself.
