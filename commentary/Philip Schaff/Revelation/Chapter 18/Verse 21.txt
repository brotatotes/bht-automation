He is a ‘mighty’ angel, the third of this kind in the Apocalypse, the other two meeting us at chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+5:2">Revelation 5:2</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+10:1">Revelation 10:1</span>. This angel acts after the manner described in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:63-64">Jeremiah 51:63-64</span>, only that here, in order to bring out more impressively the nature of the judgment, the stone is heavy as ‘a great millstone.’ The destruction is sudden and complete. The city disappears like a stone cast into the sea (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:63-64">Jeremiah 51:63-64</span>).
