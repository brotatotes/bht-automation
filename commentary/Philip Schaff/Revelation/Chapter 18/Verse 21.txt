Revelation 18:21.  And a mighty angel took up a stone as a great millstone and cast it into the sea.  A symbolic representation of the destruction of Babylon is to be given; and for this new vision a third angel appears, the first having appeared at chap. Revelation 17:1, the second at chap. Revelation 18:1. He is a ‘mighty’ angel, the third of this kind in the Apocalypse, the other two meeting us at chaps. Revelation 5:2 and Revelation 10:1. This angel acts after the manner described in Jeremiah 51:63-64, only that here, in order to bring out more impressively the nature of the judgment, the stone is heavy as ‘a great millstone.’ The destruction is sudden and complete. The city disappears like a stone cast into the sea (comp. Jeremiah 51:63-64).
