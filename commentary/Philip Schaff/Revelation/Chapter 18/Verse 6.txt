Revelation 18:6.  Render unto her even as she rendered, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she filled fill to her double.  The same voice is continued, but is now addressed to the ministers of judgment, the kings and the beast who have turned round upon the harlot (chap. Revelation 17:16). Judgment is administered according to the  lex talionis;  and the doubling seems to be founded on the law of Exodus 22:4; Exodus 22:7; Exodus 22:9, and on the threatening of Jeremiah 16:18. Her sins have been so great that there has been a double mention of them (Revelation 18:5), and the punishment shall be proportioned to the sin (comp. also Isaiah 40:2; Jeremiah 17:18).
