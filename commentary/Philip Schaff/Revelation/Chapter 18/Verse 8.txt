In <strong> one day</strong> her glory shall be turned to shame. In the midst of her feasting an unseen hand shall write upon the wall of her banqueting-room that she is weighed in the balances and is found wanting, and ‘that night’ she shall perish (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+47:9">Isaiah 47:9</span>), <em> </em> <strong> for mighty is the Lord God who judged her.

<p>At this point three classes of persons are introduced to us, uttering their lamentations over the fall of Babylon kings (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+18:9-10">Revelation 18:9-10</span>), merchants (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+18:11-16">Revelation 18:11-16</span>), sailors (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+18:17-19">Revelation 18:17-19</span>). At <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+18:20">Revelation 18:20</span> there follows a general call to rejoice over what has happened to her. The whole is moulded upon the lamentation over Tyre in Ezekiel 26, 27, and is of unequalled pathos.
