Revelation 18:8. With suddenness and fearfulness her plagues shall come upon her. In  one day her glory shall be turned to shame. In the midst of her feasting an unseen hand shall write upon the wall of her banqueting-room that she is weighed in the balances and is found wanting, and ‘that night’ she shall perish (comp. Isaiah 47:9),    for mighty is the Lord God who judged her.
	At this point three classes of persons are introduced to us, uttering their lamentations over the fall of Babylon kings (Revelation 18:9-10), merchants (Revelation 18:11-16), sailors (Revelation 18:17-19). At Revelation 18:20 there follows a general call to rejoice over what has happened to her. The whole is moulded upon the lamentation over Tyre in Ezekiel 26, 27, and is of unequalled pathos.
