Revelation 18:9-10. In these verses we have the lamentation of the  kings of the earth  over the disaster which they have been instrumental in accomplishing. The deeds of the wicked, even when effecting the purposes of God, bring no joy to themselves. It is the righteous only who rejoice (Revelation 18:20). Notice the threefold naming of the city, ‘the great city,’ ‘Babylon,’ ‘the mighty city.’
