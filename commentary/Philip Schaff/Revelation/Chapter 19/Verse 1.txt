Revelation 19:1. The heavenly hosts are the first to sing. Their keynote is Hallelujah, a word meaning ‘Praise the Lord,’ and found in the New Testament only here and in Revelation 19:3-4; Revelation 19:6 of this chapter. So in one song of heaven which has no termination closes the Book of Psalms, that ‘great book of the wars of the Lord,’ when the wars have ceased for ever (comp. Neale and Littledale on Psalms 150:0).
