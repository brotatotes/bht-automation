Revelation 19:10.  And I fell down before his feet to worship him,  fell overwhelmed with astonishment and delight.
	 And he saith unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow-servant and the fellow-servant of thy brethren that have the witness of Jesus: worship God. The angel reminds the Apostle that worship is due to God alone; that he himself is only his fellow-servant and the fellow-servant of all who have the witness of Jesus, whose personal possession the witness of Jesus is become.
	 For the witness of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. The words are spoken by the angel, and they contain the reason why, high as he may seem to be, he ought to be looked upon in no other light than as the  fellow-servant  of all who believe in Jesus. The argument is as follows: ‘All believers are witnesses of Jesus (comp. chap. Revelation 12:17); I, because I prophesy, and because the witness of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy, am also a witness of Jesus; thou and I therefore occupy the same footing before God, and we must worship God alone (comp. chap. Revelation 22:9).’
