<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:11">Revelation 19:11</span>. <strong> And I saw the heaven opened, and behold a white hone, and he that sat upon him, called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.</strong> It is the Lord Himself who comes to wind up the history of the world, to bring salvation to His own, and destruction to His enemies. The Heaven is opened, and a white horse appears, the same as that of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+6:2">Revelation 6:2</span>. He who then went forth ‘conquering and to conquer’ returns in triumph. His victory is won. In His own being He has proved Himself to be ‘faithful and true,’ ‘faithful’ to all His promises, ‘true’ as the essence of all that is real and everlasting.
