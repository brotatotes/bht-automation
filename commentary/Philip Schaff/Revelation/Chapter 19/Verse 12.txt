Revelation 19:12. The description of the Lord given in this verse sums up various characteristics of Him mentioned in earlier parts of the book; and the  many diadems are in token of His rule over the many nations of the world.  And he hath a name written which no one knoweth, but he himself  (comp. chaps. Revelation 2:17, Revelation 3:12). This cannot be the name of either Revelation 19:13 or Revelation 19:16, for both these names are known. It must be some name which shall be fully understood only when the union between the Redeemer and His Church is perfected.
