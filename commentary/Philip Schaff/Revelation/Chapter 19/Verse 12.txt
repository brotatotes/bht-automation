<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:12">Revelation 19:12</span>. The description of the Lord given in this verse sums up various characteristics of Him mentioned in earlier parts of the book; and the <strong> many diadems</strong> are in token of His rule over the many nations of the world. <strong> And he hath a name written which no one knoweth, but he himself </strong> (comp. chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:17">Revelation 2:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+3:12">Revelation 3:12</span>). This cannot be the name of either <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:13">Revelation 19:13</span> or <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:16">Revelation 19:16</span>, for both these names are known. It must be some name which shall be fully understood only when the union between the Redeemer and His Church is perfected.
