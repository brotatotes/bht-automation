<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:13">Revelation 19:13</span>. <strong> And he is arrayed in a garment sprinkled with blood, and his name is called The Word of God.</strong> The idea is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+63:2-3">Isaiah 63:2-3</span>, and is therefore that of a garment sprinkled not with the Warrior’s own blood, but with the blood of His enemies. ‘Is called,’ <em> i.e </em> is, and has been always, called. The resemblance to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1">1 John 1:1</span> need not be enlarged on.
