Revelation 19:13.  And he is arrayed in a garment sprinkled with blood, and his name is called The Word of God. The idea is taken from Isaiah 63:2-3, and is therefore that of a garment sprinkled not with the Warrior’s own blood, but with the blood of His enemies. ‘Is called,’  i.e  is, and has been always, called. The resemblance to John 1:1 and 1 John 1:1 need not be enlarged on.
