Revelation 19:14.  And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and pure. These armies comprise in all probability both the angels and the saints (comp. chap. Revelation 17:14). All triumph with their triumphant Head and King. But no blood is sprinkled upon  their  garments. So in Psalms 110:3 the Psalmist does not speak of Messiah’s people as fighting; they are ‘willing in the day that He warreth’ (Perowne).
