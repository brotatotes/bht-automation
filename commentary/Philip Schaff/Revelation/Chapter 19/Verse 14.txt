<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:14">Revelation 19:14</span>. <strong> And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and pure.</strong> These armies comprise in all probability both the angels and the saints (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:14">Revelation 17:14</span>). All triumph with their triumphant Head and King. But no blood is sprinkled upon <em> their </em> garments. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:3">Psalms 110:3</span> the Psalmist does not speak of Messiah’s people as fighting; they are ‘willing in the day that He warreth’ (Perowne).
