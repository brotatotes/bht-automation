<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:16">Revelation 19:16</span>. <strong> And he hath on his garment and on his thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.</strong> The name mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:12">Revelation 19:12</span> was probably written on the forehead. The place of this name is different. It seems to have been written on the garment where it covers the thigh to which the sword is bound (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:3">Psalms 45:3</span>). For the name itself comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:14">Revelation 17:14</span>. What was there indicated in prophecy is here realized. The warfare of the Lord is ended: ‘All kings shall fall down before Him: all nations shall serve Him’(<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+72:11">Psalms 72:11</span>).
