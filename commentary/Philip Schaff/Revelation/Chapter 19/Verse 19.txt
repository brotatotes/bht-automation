Revelation 19:19.  And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the hone and against his army. No doubt the ‘war’ is that of chap. Revelation 16:14. It is the final war waged by the beast and his ten kings and their armies against Jesus and His army. The ‘army’ of the latter is in the singular; the ‘armies’ of the former are in the plural. The thought of the unity of the one compared with the inner dissensions of the other lies at the bottom of the change (comp. chap. Revelation 11:8).
