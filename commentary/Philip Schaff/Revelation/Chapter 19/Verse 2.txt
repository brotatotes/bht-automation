Revelation 19:2. The word true of this verse again expresses what is real; not merely that God has fulfilled His words, but that His judgments correspond to the reality and propriety of things. For he hath judged the great harlot, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and he hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. The judgment particularly in view is specified in these words. We may observe how strictly it corresponds to the prayer of chap. Revelation 6:10, ‘judge,’ ‘avenge.’
