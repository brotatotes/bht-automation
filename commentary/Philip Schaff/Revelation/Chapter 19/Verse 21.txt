<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:21">Revelation 19:21</span>. And the rest were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, even the sword that went out of his month, and all the birds were filled with their flesh. By ‘the rest’ here spoken of it seems probable that we are to understand all who have imbibed the principles of the beast and the false prophet, as distinguished from these two great enemies of Christ themselves. In like manner we read in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+12:17">Revelation 12:17</span> of ‘the rest’ of the woman’s seed, as distinguished from the body of the professing Church. This ‘rest’ might have partaken of the supper of the Lamb, but they rejected the light because they loved the darkness; and the evil which they chose now brings with it swift and irresistible destruction.
