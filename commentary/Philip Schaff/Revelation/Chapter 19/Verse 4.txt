Revelation 19:4.  The four and twenty elders and the four living creatures respond to the song of the heavenly host. The Elders we heard last at chap. Revelation 11:16, at the moment when the seventh trumpet had sounded, and the ‘great voices in heaven’ had declared, ‘The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ.’ One of the four living creatures we saw last at chap. Revelation 15:7, when it gave to the seven angels their ‘seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God.’ With peculiar propriety, therefore, these beings first answer the hosts of heaven with their loud  Amen, and then take up their song  Hallelujah.
