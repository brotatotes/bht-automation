<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:6">Revelation 19:6</span>. <strong> And I heard as it were a voice of a great multitude, and as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah, for the Lord hath taken to him his kingdom, even our God, the Almighty.</strong> The song is new, celebrating something greater and higher than the last, not merely judgment on foes, but the full taking possession of His kingdom by the Lord.
