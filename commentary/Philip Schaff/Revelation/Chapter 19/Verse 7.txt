Revelation 19:7.  Let us rejoice, and be exceeding glad, and let us give the glory to him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. Up to this time the actual marriage of the Redeemer to His people has not taken place. The two patties have only been betrothed to one another (comp. 2 Corinthians 11:2). At length the hour has come when the marriage shall be completed, the Lord Himself being manifested in glory and His bride along with Him.
