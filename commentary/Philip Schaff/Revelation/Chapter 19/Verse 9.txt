<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:9">Revelation 19:9</span>. <strong> And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they that are bidden unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.</strong> We are not distinctly informed who the person here spoken of is; but, inasmuch as we seem to be still dealing with the ‘strong angel’ of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+18:21">Revelation 18:21</span>, we are probably to think of him. Alter the marriage comes the marriage supper, the fulness of blessing to be enjoyed by the redeemed. It may be a question whether we are to distinguish between the bride herself and those who appear rather to be spoken of as guests at the marriage supper. But the analogy of Scripture, and especially of such passages as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:2">Matthew 22:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:29">Matthew 26:29</span>, leads to the conclusion that no such distinction can be drawn. Those who are faithful in the Lord are at once the Lamb’s bride, and the Lamb’s guests. Any difficulty of interpretation arises simply from the difficulty, so often met with, of representing under one figure the varied relations between the Lord and His people. By the Lamb’s wife, too, we must surely understand the whole believing Church, and not any separate section of it distinguished from, and more highly favoured than, the rest. As there is one Bridegroom so there is one bride. If, therefore, according to the opinion of many, we are dealing here with the 144,000 of chap. 14, an additional proof will be afforded that in that mystical number the whole company of believers was included.

<p><strong> And he said unto me, These are the true words of God.</strong> The word ‘These’ refers, not to all that has been revealed since chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1">Revelation 17:1</span>, but to the last revelations made; and they are ‘true,’ expressive of the great realities now taking place.
