<p>With the beginning of this chapter we enter upon the fifth great section of the Apocalypse, which extends to chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:6">Revelation 20:6</span>. The object of the section is to bring before us the triumph and rest of the faithful disciples of Jesus after their conflict is over. They have had to contend alike with the world and with the degenerate Church. They have been separated from both; and both have fallen. There is no more struggle for them now, except the final one yet to be described in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:7-15">Revelation 20:7-15</span>. So far as they are concerned, however, that, as we shall see hereafter, can hardly be called a struggle, for their enemies shall no sooner be gathered together against them than they shall be completely and for ever overwhelmed. The first notice of this happy state is presented in the song of thanksgiving sung by the heavenly hosts and by the redeemed from among men over the destruction of Babylon.
