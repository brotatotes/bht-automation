<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:16">Revelation 2:16</span>. The exhortation follows. <strong> Repent therefore,</strong> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:5">Revelation 2:5</span> to Ephesus, <strong> or else I come onto thee quickly.</strong> Comp. on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:5">Revelation 2:5</span>, but note that the word ‘quickly’ is now added, although the coming is still special, not general. We have again an illustration of that climactic style of address which appears in these Epistles when they are considered as a whole. Ana will make war against them with the sword of my month. The Lord will come to war against the Nicolaitans, not against the church. Against His Church, even in her declension, He cannot war. Her threatened punishment (and is it not enough?) is, that the Lord will make war upon His enemies without her; and that, not taking part in His struggle, she shall lose her part in His victory. It is difficult to say whether in the sword spoken of there may be any allusion to the sword of the angel in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:23">Numbers 22:23</span>; but such an idea is not improbable.
