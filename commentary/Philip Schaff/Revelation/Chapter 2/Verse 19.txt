<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:19">Revelation 2:19</span>. The words I <strong> know thy works,</strong> which had been omitted from the second and third Epistles, are resumed in the fourth, and they meet us in each of the four Epistles of the second group. The general term ‘works’ is next

<p>specialized into four parts, or two groups of two members each, the members of the first group corresponding to those of the second. <strong> Love </strong> shows itself in <strong> Ministry; Faith</strong> in <strong> Patience </strong> or <strong> </strong> endurance. But more than this. Thyatira’s <strong> last works are more than the first.</strong> Not that ‘ministry’ and ‘patience’ are greater than ‘love’ and ‘faith,’ or that they alone deserve the designation ‘works.’ That term is as applicable to the latter as to the former. The fact commended is that there is progress <em> in them all. </em> The path of the church has been as the morning light shining unto the perfect day. She has not fallen back like Ephesus; she has advanced.
