<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:2">Revelation 2:2</span>. The address to the Church follows, embracing <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:2-6">Revelation 2:2-6</span>. The first part of it, extending to the close of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:3">Revelation 2:3</span>, seems to contain seven points of commendation: (1) <strong> I know thy works, and thy toil and patience.</strong> By the word ‘know’ we are to understand not approbation, but simply experimental knowledge; and by ‘works,’ not hero-deeds, but simply the whole tone and conduct of the church’s life, together with the outward manifestation of what she was. These works are then resolved into two parts; ‘toil,’ which is more than labour in the service of the Lord; and ‘patience,’ which is more than the passive virtue commonly represented by that word. The meaning would be better expressed by ‘endurance,’ the strong, firm, and manly bearing of all suffering inflicted by a hostile world for the sake of Christ (2) <strong> And that thou canst not bear evil men. </strong> The ‘evil men’ referred to are a different class from those spoken of in the following clause, and they are thought of as a burden too heavy to be borne. The Ephesian church had a holy impatience of those who, by their evil deeds, brought disgrace upon the Christian name, and she is commended for it. (3) <strong> And thou didst try them that call themselves apostles.</strong> These persons had made a special claim to be apostles (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:13">2 Corinthians 11:13</span>), even in all probability disowning St. John himself. But the Ephesian Christians had ‘tried,’ and in trying had discovered their false pretensions. The Greek word here used for ‘try’ is different from that found in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1">1 John 4:1</span>, where we read, ‘Believe not every spirit, but prove (not, as in the Authorised Version, ‘try’) the spirits, whether they are of God.’ A distinction has been drawn between the two, the latter being referred to faith and doctrine, the former to works; and the distinction has been thought to find support in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:6">Revelation 2:6</span>. But the false teachers there spoken of are not the same as those mentioned in the clause before us. The distinction seems rather to lie in this, that ‘try’ expresses simply the trial, with the superadded thought of disinclination to the persons tried; that ‘prove’ expresses the bringing forth of solid worth by trial (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:3">1 Corinthians 16:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:8">2 Corinthians 8:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:10">1 Timothy 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:7">1 Peter 1:7</span>). Here, therefore, ‘prove’ could not be used. The Ephesian church knew what these deceivers would show themselves to be, and turned from them with the instinct of the Christian heart before it put them to a formal proof.
	</p>
<p><strong> And they are not, </strong> not as in the Authorised Version with the omission of the word ‘they.’ The addition of the clause, when compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:1">1 John 3:1</span>, affords an interesting illustration of the style of the apostle, for ‘and such we are’ ought there to be inserted in the text (comp also chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+3:9">Revelation 3:9</span>). (4) <strong> And didst find them false</strong> (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+3:9">Revelation 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:6">1 John 1:6</span>).
	</p>
<p>There is no evidence to show that false teachers such as these could have existed only in the very earliest period of the Christian Church, that they cannot be assigned to the closing years of the first century, and that the Apocalypse must there-fore have been written before the destruction of Jerusalem. The words of St. Paul to the Ephesian Presbyters in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:29">Acts 20:29</span> lead rather to the belief that the manifestation there spoken of would not take place until at least most of the apostles had been removed from this earthly scene.
