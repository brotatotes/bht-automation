<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:21">Revelation 2:21</span>. (3) <strong> And I gave her time that she should repent.</strong> It is intended by the use of the word ‘time’ here, that we should fix our thoughts upon the delay of the Son of God in executing His righteous judgments (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+10:6">Revelation 10:6</span>). All along punishment was deserved, but He withheld His hand that His goodness might lead the evil-doers to repentance. (4) <strong> She willeth not to repent of her fornication.</strong> The delay was in vain. The hearts of these transgressors was set in them to do evil. They ‘willed’ not to repent. The expression is remarkable and characteristic (comp. on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:6">John 5:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:21">John 6:21</span>).
