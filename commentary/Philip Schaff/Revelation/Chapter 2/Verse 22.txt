Revelation 2:22.  Behold, I do cast her into a bed, etc. The bed is not one of lust, but of sickness and sorrow (comp. Psalms 41:3).
	 And them that commit adultery with her. We are not to understand that she is the adulteress with whom sin is committed, but that, as she is an adulteress, so they along with her are also adulterers and adulteresses. Except they repent out of her works. The contrast of ‘they’ and ‘her’ in these words is worthy of notice, showing as it does the close identification of the followers of Jezebel with herself (comp. John 9:4, and note there).
