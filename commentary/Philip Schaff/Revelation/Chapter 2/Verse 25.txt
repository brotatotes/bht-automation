<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:25">Revelation 2:25</span>. <strong> But what ye have hold fast until I shall have come.</strong> It is important to notice the change of expression in the original for the ‘coming’ spoken of. Twice already in this chapter (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:5">Revelation 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:16">Revelation 2:16</span>) have we read of a coming of the Lord, but on each of these two occasions it was closely associated with, and limited by, the words ‘unto thee.’ These ‘comings’ therefore referred not so much to the final coming as to special judgments in which it was foreshadowed: this refers rather to that in which all special judgments culminate, the Second and final Coming. Again we see another trace of the climactic nature of these Epistles.
