Revelation 2:26.  And he that overcometh. We come now to the promise contained in this Epistle for the faithful, and it will be observed that for the first time it is not preceded by the call to him ‘that hath ears to hear.’ That call in the four last Epistles of the seven is reserved for the close (comp. on Revelation 2:7).
	 And he that keepeth my works unto the end. The construction of the original shows that this description is distinct from the preceding. Attention ought to be directed to the expression ‘My works,’ commentators appearing to miss their force. They are not simply the works which Jesus commands, but those which He does, a fresh illustration of that close identification of Jesus with His people which marks the writings of St. John. We meet the opposite identification, that of Jezebel and her followers, in Revelation 2:22.
	 To him will I give authority over the nations. By the ‘nations’ we are not to understand the nations as such, but the nations as opposed to the true Israel of God, and as alienated from God, properly the Gentiles. The allusion is to Psalms 2:8-9; and the believer shall not merely have power, but rightful power, authority, over them.
