<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:4">Revelation 2:4</span>. Commendation has been bestowed; the deserved blame that had been incurred now follows: <strong> Nevertheless I have against thee that thou didst let go thy first love.</strong> The Authorised Version is here materially injured by the insertion of the word ‘somewhat,’ to which there is nothing in the original to correspond. The declension was a serious and not a slight one, the letting go the ‘kindness of her youth,’ the ‘love of her espousals’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jer+2:2">Jeremiah 2:2</span>), the love with which the church had met her Lord ‘in the day of His espousals, and in the day of the gladness of His heart’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="so+3:11">Song of Solomon 3:11</span>). Nothing but the love of the bride can satisfy the Bridegroom; all zeal for His honour, if He is to value it, must flow from love, and love must feed its flame. There is no contradiction between the state now described and that in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:2-3">Revelation 2:2-3</span>. Nor is there any need to think that these latter verses apply only to the ‘angel’ as if he were a distinct personality, while this verse applies to the church at large. The history of the Christian Church has been too full of zeal without love to justify any doubt as to the verisimilitude of the picture. <strong> Let the times </strong> immediately subsequent to the successful struggle against Arianism, and again to the Reformation in Germany, testify to the fact.
