The Lord cannot leave them without a fresh word of commendation. <strong> But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</strong> Who the persons thus referred to were we shall best learn at <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:15">Revelation 2:15</span>. In the meantime it is enough to say that we have here more than a mere repetition of what had been said already at <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:2">Revelation 2:2</span>; and that the last words, ‘which I also hate,’ appear to be added partly at least for the sake of bringing out the fact that, notwithstanding the declension of the Ephesian Christians, there was still one point on which their Lord and they were similarly minded.
