<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:10">Revelation 20:10</span>. <strong> And the devil that deceiveth them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the beast and the false prophet; and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</strong> The last great enemy of the Church is now overcome and destroyed as the beast and the false prophet have already been (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:20">Revelation 19:20</span>). He is cast into the lake of fire, where all three are tormented for ever and ever. It is presupposed in this everlasting torment that they have made their final and unchangeable choice of evil. This is indicated in the words ‘that deceiveth,’ the present tense leading us to the thought of the essential character, not the present action, of the great enemy of man.
