<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:11">Revelation 20:11</span>. <strong> And I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.</strong> The throne that is seen is ‘great,’ not so much in contrast with the thrones of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4">Revelation 20:4</span>, as in correspondence with the Great Being who sits upon it. It is also ‘white,’ emblematic of His perfect purity and righteousness. He that sits upon it is Christ, not God, although we may remember that Christ is the revelation of God, and the Doer of the Father’s will. From before His face the earth and the heavens flee away, <em> 1e, </em> they are completely removed, time aid earth and all that belongs to them coming to an end. Similar descriptions, although not so complete, have already met us at chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+6:14">Revelation 6:14</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+16:20">Revelation 16:20</span>.
