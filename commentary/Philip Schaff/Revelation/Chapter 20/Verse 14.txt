<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:14">Revelation 20:14</span>. <strong> And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, even the lake of fire. </strong> The first part of this verse has been spoken of. The second part explains that the second death is ‘the lake of fire,’ clearly showing that the second death is a <em> state. </em> It is the state of those who have chosen and confirmed to themselves the death which came upon man by sin, from which Christ redeems, but which becomes to those who wilfully reject His redemption a still more fearful, even the second, death.
