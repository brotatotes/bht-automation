Revelation 20:15.  And if any one was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire. Here then is the purpose, and the only one, for which ‘the book of life’ is spoken of as used at the judgment before us. It was searched in order that it might be seen if any one’s name was  not  written in it; and he whose name could not be discovered in its pages was cast into the lake of fire. For a carefulness of expression very similar to that of these words see John 10:16 and note.
	From all that has been said it will be apparent that the judgment now described is not a general judgment, but one on the wicked only. The first view is no doubt that which most naturally suggests itself to the reader of the passage, until he examines more particularly the expressions that are employed, and calls to mind the whole style of thought exhibited in this book. But (1) The thought of a general judgment breaks the continuity of the scene. The passage, as a whole, is occupied with judgment upon the enemies of the Church. The interposition of a judgment, and consequent reward, of the righteous disturbs the even now of the description: (2) It is very difficult to imagine that those who have already reigned with Christ in the thousand years, and to whom judgment either relating to themselves or over others has been ‘given’ (Revelation 20:4), should now be placed at the judgment bar: (3) Add to all this the use and meaning in St. John’s writings of such words as ‘the dead,’ ‘judged,’ ‘the sea,’ ‘death,’ and ‘Hades,’ and it appears impossible to adopt any other conclusion than that in the vision now before us we have a judgment of the wicked, and not a general judgment.
