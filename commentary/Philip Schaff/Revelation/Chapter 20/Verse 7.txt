<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:7">Revelation 20:7</span>. <strong> And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison. </strong> The meaning of the first clause of this verse cannot be properly discussed until, in some closing remarks on the chapter, we resume consideration of the whole question of what we are to understand by ‘the thousand years.’ Meanwhile, therefore, it is enough to mark the fact that Satan is represented as loosed out of the prison to which he had been consigned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:3">Revelation 20:3</span>, in order that he may practise that work of ‘deception’ on ‘the nations’ which had been alluded to in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:2">Revelation 20:2</span>.
