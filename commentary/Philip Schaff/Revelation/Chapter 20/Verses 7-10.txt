<p>The happy pause described from chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:1">Revelation 19:1</span> to chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:6">Revelation 20:6</span> comes to an end, and we enter upon the sixth leading section of the book. The section extends from chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:7">Revelation 20:7</span> to chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+22:5">Revelation 22:5</span>, and its object is to show that, though opposed by so many adversaries and led through so many trials, the saints of God shall at the last be victorious. Their great enemy Satan is completely overthrown, and the new Jerusalem descends from heaven to be their abode of perpetual purity and peace and joy. The first paragraph of this section extends from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:7">Revelation 20:7</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:10">Revelation 20:10</span> of the present chapter. It contains a new and final assault upon the saints; but the assault is at once and ignominiously defeated.
