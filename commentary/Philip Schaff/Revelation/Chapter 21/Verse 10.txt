<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:10">Revelation 21:10</span>. <strong> The Seer is carried in the spirit, for </strong> this purpose, <strong> to a great and high mountain. </strong> The object is that he may command a more uninterrupted view of the holy city as she descends in all her glory from heaven to earth. It was from the top of an ‘exceeding high mountain’ that Satan showed our Lord all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, and for a similar purpose, that he may see more clearly the grandeur of the spectacle before his eyes, is St. John elevated to this height. Comparison of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eze+40:2">Ezekiel 40:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:2">Isaiah 2:2</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:22">Hebrews 12:22</span> makes it probable that the city was situated upon the ‘mountain,’ and we are therefore to understand this word not in the sense of a solitary peak but, as often in the Gospels, in that of a range of mountains where from peak to peak the view is less hampered than in the plain. The harlot in chap. 17 was a city, Babylon; the Lamb’s wife is a city, New Jerusalem.
