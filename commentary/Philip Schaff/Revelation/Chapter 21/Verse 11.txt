Revelation 21:11. The description of the city begins, and first she is spoken of as  having the glory of God. This light lightens her both within and without. From the subsequent description it appears that the idea of the Holy of Holies is in the Seer’s mind, and we cannot therefore be wrong in thinking that the ‘glory’ which he has in view is that of the Shechinah. By it the Almighty lightened of old the innermost recesses of His sanctuary. By it He now lightens the whole of that glorious abode in which His people dwell with Him.
	 Her light was like unto a stone most precious, as it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal. The word of the original translated ‘light’ is rather light-bearer or light-giver, and it refers to the light which the city sheds everywhere around her like the sun or the stars of heaven. It is light of crystalline clearness and purity (comp. chap. Revelation 4:3).
