<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:15">Revelation 21:15</span>. The city is to be measured, in order that its noble and fair proportions may be seen. The angel measures it with <strong> a golden reed,</strong> the metal of the reed corresponding in dignity and value to the city itself, which is of ‘pure gold’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:18">Revelation 21:18</span>). A measuring reed, though not of gold, is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eze+40:3">Ezekiel 40:3</span>.
