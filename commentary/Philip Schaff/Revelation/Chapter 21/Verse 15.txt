Revelation 21:15. The city is to be measured, in order that its noble and fair proportions may be seen. The angel measures it with  a golden reed, the metal of the reed corresponding in dignity and value to the city itself, which is of ‘pure gold’ (Revelation 21:18). A measuring reed, though not of gold, is used in Ezekiel 40:3.
