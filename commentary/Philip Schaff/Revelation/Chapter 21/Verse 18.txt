<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:18">Revelation 21:18</span>. The measuring has been completed. We have next the materials of which the city was composed. Those of the wall are first mentioned. <strong> And the building of the wall of it was jasper. </strong> We have been already told in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:11">Revelation 21:11</span> that the light shining from the city was like that of a jasper stone. The wall, which was of jasper, must have shone with a like crystalline clearness, a distinct proof of the falseness of the idea which makes ‘the wall’ low in order that it may not obstruct the light of the city.

<p><strong> And the city was pure gold, </strong> the most precious metal known, but in this case transfigured and glorified, for it was <strong> like unto pure glass.
