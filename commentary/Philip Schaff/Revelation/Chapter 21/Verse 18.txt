Revelation 21:18. The measuring has been completed. We have next the materials of which the city was composed. Those of the wall are first mentioned.  And the building of the wall of it was jasper.  We have been already told in Revelation 21:11 that the light shining from the city was like that of a jasper stone. The wall, which was of jasper, must have shone with a like crystalline clearness, a distinct proof of the falseness of the idea which makes ‘the wall’ low in order that it may not obstruct the light of the city.
	 And the city was pure gold,  the most precious metal known, but in this case transfigured and glorified, for it was  like unto pure glass.
