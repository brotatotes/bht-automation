<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span>. The Apostle beholds the metropolis of the renovated world under the figure of that metropolis which was so intimately associated with the memories and aspirations of the people of God, <strong> a New Jerusalem.</strong> Her newness will be afterwards more particularly described, but even now we are told enough to convey to us a lofty idea of her grandeur and beauty. She comes down <strong> out of heaven, from God, and she is</strong> <strong> prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</strong> Is there not a reminiscence in the word ‘prepared’ of that great promise in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:3">John 14:3</span> which the apostle who saw this vision was to record? The Bridegroom is now the ‘Husband’ (comp. ‘wife’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9">Revelation 21:9</span>).
