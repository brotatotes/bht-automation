Revelation 21:21. Having described the foundations, the Apostle now passes to the gates and street of the city.  And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl. No attempt is made to attain verisimilitude. It is enough that the figure helps to bring out the surpassing splendour.
	 And the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.  We are probably not to think of only one street, for a city so large, and with so many gates, must have had many streets. But it is unnecessary to dwell upon them all. Each is of the same material as the rest, and all are of gold, but, as in Revelation 21:18, of gold transfigured and glorified.
