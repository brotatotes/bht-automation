<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:23">Revelation 21:23</span>. As the city was independent of the outward and ordinary means of grace, so also it was independent of the outward influences which nature supplies for the help of man. <strong> It hath no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine upon it.</strong> In our present condition all nature is sacramental to the believing eye or ear. All tells of the supernatural behind nature. But now the shadows flee away, and God and the Lamb revealing God lighten the city with their immediate light.

<p><strong> The</strong> <strong> glory of God</strong> spoken of is again the Shechinah, the visible symbol of His presence.
	</p>
<p><strong> The Lamb is the lamp thereof.</strong> It may seem as if mention of the ‘lamp’ detracted from the loftiness of the imagery; but, when there is neither sun nor moon, we naturally think of the lamp which men use at night. May there not also be an allusion to the lamps of the Golden Candlestick of the Sanctuary?
