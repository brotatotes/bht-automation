<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:24">Revelation 21:24</span>. The description of the glory of the New Jerusalem is continued in figures taken from the prophets of the Old Testament (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:2-3">Isaiah 60:2-3</span>). <strong> And the nations shall walk by the light of it.</strong> We are not required invariably to understand the heathen by the word ‘nations,’ or the faithful of the Old Covenant by the word ‘people.’ It appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:50-52">John 11:50-52</span> (see note there) that there is a sense in which the theocratic people are a ‘nation,’ and the heathen gathered into the flock of Christ a part of His ‘people.’ In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:3">Revelation 21:3</span> of this very chapter, too, we have read of a time when God shall dwell with men, and they shall be ‘His peoples.’ The two terms ‘nation’ and ‘people’ may, therefore, be applied to the same persons viewed in different aspects. The ‘peoples’ of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:3">Revelation 21:3</span> are the ‘nations’ of this verse and of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+22:2">Revelation 22:2</span>; and the choice of the different expressions is probably determined by the consideration that in the one God is thought of as ‘tabernacling’ in the midst of His people, in the other as being His people’s ‘light’ (comp. note on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20">Revelation 1:20</span>, where we have a remarkable parallel both in thought and structure). The ‘nations’ are not converted heathen alone, but all who, whether Jew or Gentile, walk in the light.

<p><strong> And the kings of the earth do bring their glory into it.</strong> Not the masses of the nations only, but their highest representatives and dignitaries submit themselves with all that they have to the sway of Him who now rules in righteousness, the universal King.
