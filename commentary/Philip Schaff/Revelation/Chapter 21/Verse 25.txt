<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:25">Revelation 21:25</span>. <strong> And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day; for there shall be no night there. </strong> The design of the words is to set forth the perfect peace and security of the inhabitants of the heavenly city. How often had the gates of an ancient city to be closed, always by night, often by day! How often had measures of precaution to be taken against apprehended danger! Here there is no danger, no apprehension, no enemy to approach the gate, but happiness perfect and for ever undisturbed. The explanation of the last clause of the verse, beginning as it does with the word ‘for,’ has afforded some cause of perplexity to interpreters. Yet the explanation generally given is satisfactory. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:11">Isaiah 60:11</span> the prophet, speaking of the future city of God, had said, ‘Thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night.’ St. John is referring to that passage, but he could not adopt it as it stood, and he would explain why he stopped short at the word ‘day’ of the prophet He could not bring the thought of ‘night’ <em> </em> into connection with the New Jerusalem, for there was ‘no night there.’ There may have been something more in his thoughts. We know from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:30">John 13:30</span> the symbolical meaning which he attached to the word ‘night’ ‘It was night’ when Judas went out upon his errand of treachery and crime. The first clause of the verse contains the emblem of security and peace. The second assigns the reason why these shall continue undisturbed. There shall be no night there, no darkness either physical or moral, neither men nor deeds that shun the light.
