<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:26">Revelation 21:26</span>. <strong> And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.</strong> Such shall be the use made of the open gates. The nations shall stream into the city with their gifts, to lay their best upon its altars, and to enjoy in turn its rest and peace and security and light. The New Jerusalem receives freely, and possesses for ever, the glory and honour of the lungs of the earth. She receives without seeking it all that Babylon had become a harlot to obtain, and could not keep.
