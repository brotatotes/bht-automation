For these purposes alone shall the open gates be used. <strong> There shall in no wise enter into it anything unclean, or he that maketh an abomination and a lie.</strong> There is indeed now nothing unclean; there is no wilful sinner of any kind to enter. All the enemies of God have been overcome: all sin has been banished for ever.

<p><strong> But they only which are written in the Lambâ€™s book of life.</strong> Such alone are found upon the earth; and, as we lift our eyes to the city, we behold them flocking in from the East and from the West, from the North and from the South, their toilsome pilgrimage closed, their hard struggle ended, their glory come.
