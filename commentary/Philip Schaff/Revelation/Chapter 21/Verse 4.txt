<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:4">Revelation 21:4</span>. All the most precious fruits of such a fellowship shall also be experienced. <strong> He shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.</strong> Not ‘all tears’ are spoken of, but ‘every tear.’ Each single tear they shed shall be wiped away, even before it falls.
	</p>
<p><strong> And death shall be no more.</strong> It has been destroyed by Him who ‘was dead, and behold, He is alive for evermore’ (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span>); and it can no longer disturb with its terrors, or its separations between the loving and the loved.
	</p>
<p><strong> Neither shall there be mourning.</strong> The reference is not to mourning in general, but to wailing for the dead.
	</p>
<p><strong> Nor crying, nor pain, any more. </strong> ‘Crying’ is the acute cry produced by any pain: ‘pain’ is the burden laid upon us by any woe, especially by such woes as are connected with the toils and sufferings of the present outward world. From all sorrow whether sharp or dull; from all burdens whether proceeding from the body or the mind, the dwellers in the New Jerusalem shall be for ever free. These trials belonged to the <em> first things, </em> to the old earth; and the old earth, the ‘first things,’ has passed away.
