Revelation 21:5. What the Seer had before heard regarding the new creation had proceeded from a voice ‘out of the throne’ (Revelation 21:3). Now God  Himself, he that sitteth on the throne, speaks. For the first time in this book the direct voice of God is heard. Hitherto He has been veiled in His own  unspeakable  majesty and glory, watching indeed with the deepest interest the fortunes of His Church, overruling all things for her good, but Himself unseen, unheard. Now He   breaks His silence; and, as One who dwells with men (Revelation 21:4), directs their thoughts to the accomplishment of His own holy and gracious will. His words are,  I make all things new, where the emphasis  rests upon the word ‘new:’ ‘Old things are passed away; behold, they are become new’ (2 Corinthians 5:17). It is possible that the next words spoken in this verse,  Write; for these words are faithful and true,  may be the voice not of God, but of an angel. As no angel, however, has been spoken of in the preceding verses, and as the words now uttered are properly a parenthesis indicating the deep interest of the Almighty in His people, there is no sufficient cause to bring in the interposition of any third party. God Himself says to His servant ‘Write,’ and Himself assures him not only that His words are ‘faithful’ but that they are ‘true.’ The new heavens and the new earth are the end towards which God has been always working. The whole history of the world, with its opposition to the truth and: with the judgments that have overtaken it; the whole history of the Church, with her struggles and victories, has not been accidental. It has been the carrying out of God’s ‘bright designs’ from the moment when He expressed Himself in the works and in the creatures of His hands.
