<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:6">Revelation 21:6</span>. The voice of God is continued, as He says, They, <em> i.e. </em> the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:5">Revelation 21:5</span>, are come to pass. The future for which the saints of God have longed, and of which the prophets spoke, has come. All expectations are fulfilled; all hopes are realized; the end to which all things pointed is reached. Hence, accordingly, the close connexion of the next words with these, <strong> I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.</strong> God is the unchangeable, the everlasting, One; the first cause, the last end, of all things. He must finish that new creation for the coming of which the sins and sorrows of the world have been only the preparatory throes.

<p><strong> I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.</strong> These words are neither a call nor a promise to labouring and heavy-laden ones in search of rest, and they find their parallel in the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:14">John 4:14</span> rather than of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:37">John 7:37</span>. Those spoken of have already drunk of the living water, and been refreshed by it. Not the longing after salvation, but the longing for a continued and ever deepening participation in its blessings, is expressed by the word ‘athirst.’ The redeemed not only find their first life in Christ: they draw from Him continually those ever fresh supplies of grace by which they are sustained in spiritual life and joy.
