<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:7">Revelation 21:7</span>. <strong> He that overcometh</strong> is the same as he that is ‘athirst,’ and is only viewed in another aspect of his glorious position. In reference to Jesus he is always thirsty; in reference to the world and the devil he is always a conqueror. By the use of the word ‘overcometh,’ the last part of the Apocalypse is bound closely to its first (comp. the promises in chaps. 2-3).
	</p>
<p>The promise is, <strong> I will be his God, and he shall be my son.</strong> God will be his God, his Father: he will be God’s son, enjoying the spirit of adoption by which we cry, Abba, Father, and living in that love and confidence which mark a son in a loving father’s house and presence.
