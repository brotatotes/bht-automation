<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:8">Revelation 21:8</span>. The happiness of the saints of God has been described. In contrast with this, the verse before us presents us with the fate of the ungodly, who are classified first in general terms, and then by the particular sins which they commit. The ‘fearful’ are mentioned first as occupying a position the reverse of them that ‘overcome;’ they have shrunk from the struggle; they have

<p>yielded to the foe instead of conquering him. Upon the description of the other classes it is unnecessary to dwell. They are such as have chosen the darkness rather than the light; as have loved the lie rather than the truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>); as have deliberately resisted and cast aside the grace that might have been theirs, their <strong> part </strong> can be only in <strong> the second death.
