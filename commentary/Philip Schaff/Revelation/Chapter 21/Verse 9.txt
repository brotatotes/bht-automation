<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9">Revelation 21:9</span>. At chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1">Revelation 17:1</span> one of the angels that had the seven bowls had come to the Seer and shown him the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters, the mystic Babylon. In like manner one of the same group of angels, but more fully described as one of the seven <strong> who had the seven bowls, who were laden with the seven last plagues,</strong> now shows him the city that was in every respect the contrast of Babylon, not Babylon but the New Jerusalem, not a harlot but <strong> the bride the Lamb’s wife.</strong> The fuller description of the angel brings out more completely the fact that the last ‘plagues’ were over, and that nothing remained to be exhibited to the Seer but the glory of the redeemed in heaven. The combination of the terms ‘bride’ and ‘Lamb’s wife’ is remarkable. The Church is not only espoused but married to her Lord, yet she remains for ever in a virgin purity.
