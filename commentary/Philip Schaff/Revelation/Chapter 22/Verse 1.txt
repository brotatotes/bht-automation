<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1">Revelation 22:1</span>. <strong> And he showed me a river of water of lift, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</strong> No scenery is complete without water; and more especially to the Jew, accustomed to a burning climate and a thirsty land, water was the constant symbol of all that was refreshing and quickening to men. The joy of the heavenly city could not, therefore, be perfect without it, ‘There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+46:4">Psalms 46:4</span>; comp. also <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eze+47:1-12">Ezekiel 47:1-12</span>). The river here spoken of corresponds to that of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:10">Genesis 2:10</span>, but it is a still brighter stream. It comes ‘out of the throne of God and of the Lamb,’ out of the highest and most blessed of all sources, God Himself, our God, revealed to us in His Son in whom He is well pleased. The waters are those of peace and spiritual life: Jerusalem’s ‘peace is like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:12">Isaiah 66:12</span>). Not only so; the waters are ‘bright as crystal,’ of sparkling purity and clearness.
