Revelation 22:10.  And he saith unto me, Seal not up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand. At chap. Revelation 1:19 St. John had been commanded to ‘write,’ now he is commanded to proclaim what he had written. The Apocalypse was not to be a sealed and hidden book like that of Daniel (chaps. Daniel 8:26, Daniel 12:4). It was to be opened for the instruction and the guidance of the Church. There was not a moment to be lost. The Lord was at hand. Let all who believed that truth prepare themselves for His coming.
