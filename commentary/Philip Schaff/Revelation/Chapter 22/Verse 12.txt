Revelation 22:12. In conformity with the general tenor of the Apocalypse, this verse is to be regarded as addressed only to the righteous. The word  reward  in it is not to be understood in a neutral sense, but as indicating what it naturally means. Every man whose  work  is pleasing to the Lord shall receive the welcome and the blessing which the faithful Lord is ready to bestow.
