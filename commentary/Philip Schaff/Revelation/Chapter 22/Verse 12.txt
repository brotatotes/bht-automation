<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+22:12">Revelation 22:12</span>. In conformity with the general tenor of the Apocalypse, this verse is to be regarded as addressed only to the righteous. The word <em> reward </em> in it is not to be understood in a neutral sense, but as indicating what it naturally means. Every man whose <em> work </em> is pleasing to the Lord shall receive the welcome and the blessing which the faithful Lord is ready to bestow.
