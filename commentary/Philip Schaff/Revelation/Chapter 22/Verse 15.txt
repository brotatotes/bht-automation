<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+22:15">Revelation 22:15</span>. <strong> Without are the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.</strong> These words appear to be added, net so much for the sake of telling us what shall be the fate of the sinful classes mentioned, as for the sake of enhancing by contrast that description of the blessedness of the righteous which had been given in the previous verse. The latter are within the city, separated for ever from the classes now described, the very mention of which awakens pain and horror in the mind. The word ‘dogs’ is a general appellative applicable to all these classes, and is to be explained by remembering the light in which such animals were regarded by the Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:16">Psalms 22:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:20">Psalms 22:20</span>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:6">Matthew 7:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+3:2">Philippians 3:2</span>). This general appellation is then subdivided (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:8">Revelation 21:8</span>).
