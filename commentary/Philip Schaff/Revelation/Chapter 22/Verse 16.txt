<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+22:16">Revelation 22:16</span>. <strong> I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things for the churches. </strong> The closing message of the Book begins with these words, and it comes from Him who only here, and in His words to Saul (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:5">Acts 9:5</span>), calls Himself by the name ‘Jesus.’ The word, therefore, must be understood in its most emphatic sense, the Saviour, He who saves His people from their sins and leads them in triumph to the promised rest. In the words employed by Him He first confirms what had been said in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+1:1">Revelation 1:1</span>, and then points out the persons to whom as well as those for whose behoof the testimony had been given. ‘I have sent,’ it is stated, ‘unto you.’ The persons thus referred to seem to be the ‘angels’ of the churches, not special office-bearers of any kind, but the churches in their action, in their presentation of themselves to the world in life and action. It is indeed possible that, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+22:6">Revelation 22:6</span> of this chapter we found the Seer coming before us as the representative of all those there called God’s ‘servants,’ so here we may have the plural ‘you’ because he is again regarded in the same light. The other explanation, however, is simpler, and finds some confirmation in the connection between so many different parts of the Prologue and the Epilogue. While thus testified to the churches in action, the things contained in this book are testified ‘for the churches,’ <em> i.e </em> for the seven churches mentioned in chap. 1, but considered as a representation and embodiment of the whole Church. In the first words of this verse the Lord had described Himself as Jesus. The words which follow, <strong> I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright, the morning star, </strong> enlarge this description, and that in the manner of those double pictures which are so common in the writings of St. John. The first picture is taken from the circle of Jewish associations, the second from the field of the world. By the ‘root’ of David, we are not to understand that root out of which David sprang as if, when taken along with the following words, we had here a declaration that Jesus was both the ‘Lord’ and the ‘Son’ of David (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:45">Matthew 22:45</span>). The ‘root of David’ is rather the shoot which proceeds from David after he and his house have fallen, and it only expresses in a figure what is more plainly stated in the use of the word ‘offspring.’ But not only so, Jesus is also ‘the bright, the morning star,’ the most brilliant star in the firmament of heaven, now the harbinger of that day the light of which never dims. This is the Gentile, perhaps more properly the general, portion of the figure. David’s was a <em> local </em> name: the eyes of <em> all </em> nations are fixed with interest and delight upon the morning star (comp. chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+5:5">Revelation 5:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:28">Revelation 2:28</span> <em> ).
