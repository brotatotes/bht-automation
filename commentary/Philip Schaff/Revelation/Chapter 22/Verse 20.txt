<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+22:20">Revelation 22:20</span>. <strong> He which testifieth these things saith Yea: I come quickly. Amen: Come, Lord Jesus. </strong> The structure of this verse resembles what we have already found to be that of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+22:17">Revelation 22:17</span>, an exchange of sentiment between the Lord and the believer. Jesus Himself speaks first, testifying to that great truth of His Coming which has been the main theme of the whole revelation of this book; and adding, as suited the moment at which we have arrived, that He comes ‘quickly.’ To this the believer or the Church answers ‘Amen,’ and then adds, ‘Come, Lord Jesus.’ The Coming of Christ has been the source of her hope, the spring of her joy, throughout all her troubles. When she hears that it is at hand, what can she do but lift up her head and cry ‘Come’?

<p>Nothing now remains but that the Apostle, as he had begun at chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span> in epistolary form, should in like manner close. He does it with a benediction which ought to read differently from that of the Authorised Version, <strong> The grace of the Lord Jesus be with the saints. </strong> The words are in striking harmony with what we have found to be the tone and character of the whole book. It was especially intended to describe the fortunes of ‘the saints;’ it was written for their sakes, to encourage and strengthen them; it has now reached a point at which we behold nothing but saints in the new heavens and new earth; and its closing salutation is to them.

<p><strong> Amen, so let it be.
