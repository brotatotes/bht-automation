<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+22:3">Revelation 22:3</span>. <strong> And there shall be no more anything accursed, </strong> anything upon which the curse of the Almighty rests, and fit only to be cast out of His presence.
	</p>
<p><strong> And the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it.</strong> What throne is this? The three clauses that follow appear to show that it is the throne of God in the innermost recess of His sanctuary. The ‘throne’ therefore is not concealed. The redeemed have constant access to it.
	</p>
<p><strong> And his servants shall do him service. </strong> They shall perform their priestly functions for ever in His presence.
