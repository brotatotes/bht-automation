<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+22:4">Revelation 22:4</span>. <strong> And they shall see his face.</strong> It had been said to Moses by the Almighty, ‘Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see Me, and live’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+33:20">Exodus 33:20</span>). But the blessing denied to the great leader of the hosts of Israel is granted to those who are taken up into the Mount with God. He is revealed to them in the Son, and they shall ‘see Him even as He is’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>). The beatific vision of the pure in heart is that ‘they shall see God’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:8">Matthew 5:8</span>).

<p><strong> And his name shall be on their foreheads.</strong> The name referred to is that of God and of the Lamb. As the high priest of old wore upon his forehead a plate of gold with the name of Jehovah inscribed upon it. So the redeemed, now all high priests in the sanctuary, shall wear the same name upon their foreheads. Nothing is said of the golden plate. The name is written upon the forehead itself.
