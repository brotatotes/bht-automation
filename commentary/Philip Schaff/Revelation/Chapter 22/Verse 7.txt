Revelation 22:7.  And behold, I come quickly. The Lord Himself is introduced as the speaker, as He at once summarises the contents of the book, and presents to His Church that theme which was her encouragement and hope amidst all her troubles. The words are not to be regarded as those of the angel. They are rather a parenthesis on the part of St John himself, as he lovingly recalls the thought that was to him the chief spring of life and joy.
	 Blessed is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book. After the parenthesis the words of the angel are resumed. It is true, that at the time when they were uttered the book had not been written. But the command had been given that it should be written (chap. Revelation 1:19), and the task might easily be viewed as already accomplished. The book indeed was but a transcript of those eternal verities which had been written in the counsels of God from before the foundation of the world (comp. on chap. Revelation 21:5). The word ‘keepeth’ is a favourite one with the Apostle. It is not enough to hear or to enjoy. The Son ‘kept’ the Father’s commandments, and it is the test of the love of believers, ‘If ye love Me, ye will keep My commandments’ (John 14:15).
