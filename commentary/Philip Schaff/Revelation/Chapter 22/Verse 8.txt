<p><strong> And when I heard and saw I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things. </strong> Once before, at chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span>, he had done the same thing, and had been corrected for it. We need not wonder that he should do it again; nor is it necessary to think that, having just heard the words ‘Behold, I come quickly, he may have been doubtful whether the angel before him was the Lord Himself or not. Such had been the glory of the revelations that a mistake of this kind might easily be made more than once. But, whenever made, it was needful that it should be pointed out.
