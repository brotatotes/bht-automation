<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+22:9">Revelation 22:9</span>. The angel forbids the worship that would have been paid him, and adds, <strong> I am a fellow-servant with thee, and with thy brethren the prophets, and with them which keep the words of this book: worship God.</strong> Before God alone must all His creatures bow. All are only His ‘servants,’ and it is their duty to encourage one another in their mutual service. It is needless to say that distinctions of office are not here denied; but there is something deeper than office in which Christians are one.
