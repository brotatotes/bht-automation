Revelation 3:18. The counsel follows.  I counsel thee to buy of me gold refined out of fire, not that gold which cannot stand the fire of the great day, but the true gold of My kingdom, purified by being burnt in the furnace of trial, that thus thou  mayest be rich; and white garments, that thou mayest appear clothed when I come;  and eye-salve to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest see (comp. John 9:6). The three things mentioned are in obvious contrast with those spoken of in Revelation 3:17, although they are not mentioned in the same order. For ‘buy’ comp. Isaiah 55:1.
