<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+3:21">Revelation 3:21</span>. <strong> He that overcometh, to him will I grant to sit down along with me in my throne, </strong> etc. This promise is the highest of all that we have met in the seven Epistles. The throne of Jesus is the throne of God, ‘I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be perfected into one;’ ‘Father, that which Thou hast given Me, I will that, where I am, they also may be with Me’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:23-24">John 17:23-24</span>). The promise is the ‘apotheosis of victory,’ and as such it has evidently a reference not only to the church at Laodicea, but to the whole series of the seven churches, and of the promises addressed to them.
