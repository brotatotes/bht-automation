<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+3:4">Revelation 3:4</span>. Sardis was not wholly given over to evil, and the Lord does not less mark and approve the good than condemn the evil that was in her.
	</p>
<p><strong> But thou hast a few names in Sardis which did not defile their garments.</strong> It is impossible to miss the play upon the word ‘names’ as compared with ‘thou hast a name’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+3:1">Revelation 3:1</span>. A few had resisted the temptations to licentiousness so prevalent around them, and had maintained their Christian life and character in a manner corresponding to the pure and lofty aims of the faith which they professed. Hence the promise, again leading us back to the grace to which it is attached: <strong> they shall walk along with me in white.</strong> The grace which clothed them even here as a white robe shall become a robe of glory. Their glory shall be the very glory of their Lord, for there is force in the preposition ‘along with;’ they shall be sharers in what the glorified Redeemer is.
	</p>
<p><strong> For they are worthy</strong> (comp. for contrast, chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+16:5-6">Revelation 16:5-6</span>).
