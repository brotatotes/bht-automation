Revelation 3:5.  He that overcometh shall thus be clothed in white garments. He shall be clothed about, shall be wrapped round and round with the glistering glory of Revelation 3:4.
	 And I will in no wise blot out his name out of the book of life.  The ‘book of life’ is a book conceived of as a register, containing the names of the true citizens of Zion (cp. Exodus 32:32; Daniel 12:1; Luke 10:20; Revelation 13:8; Revelation 17:8; Revelation 20:12; Revelation 21:27, 12:19. There is no statement here that there is such a process of erasure of names from the book of life as may warrant us in saying that names once admitted to that book are being continually blotted out. Nor is such a thought in harmony with the general teaching of the Apocalypse, which looks rather at the number of the saved and of the lost as being from the first complete. What we are told is, not that some names shall be blotted out, but that certain names shall in no wise be so.
	 And I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels  (cp. Matthew 10:32-33).   He who has sought no  name  before men (comp. Revelation 3:1) shall have his ‘name’ con-fessed by his Lord in the great day.
