<p><strong> And I will in no wise blot out his name out of the book of life. </strong> The ‘book of life’ is a book conceived of as a register, containing the names of the true citizens of Zion (cp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:32">Exodus 32:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="da+12:1">Daniel 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:20">Luke 10:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+13:8">Revelation 13:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8">Revelation 17:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:12">Revelation 20:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:27">Revelation 21:27</span>, 12:19. There is no statement here that there is such a process of erasure of names from the book of life as may warrant us in saying that names once admitted to that book are being continually blotted out. Nor is such a thought in harmony with the general teaching of the Apocalypse, which looks rather at the number of the saved and of the lost as being from the first complete. What we are told is, not that some names shall be blotted out, but that certain names shall in no wise be so.

<p><strong> And I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels </strong> (cp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:32-33">Matthew 10:32-33</span>). <strong> </strong> He who has sought no <em> name </em> before men (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+3:1">Revelation 3:1</span>) shall have his ‘name’ con-fessed by his Lord in the great day.
