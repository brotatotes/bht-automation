<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+4:10">Revelation 4:10</span>. <strong> The four and twenty elders shall fall down before him that sitteth on the throne, and shall worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and shall cast their crowns before the throne, saying.</strong> Three acts of worship and homage on the part of the elders are described, ‘falling down,’ ‘worshipping,’ and ‘casting their crowns before the throne.’ It is not necessary to ask whether the crowns thus cast down are again resumed, for it is simply the act of homage that is described. The song of the Church follows.
