<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+4:5">Revelation 4:5</span>. The description is continued with the mention of lightnings and voices and thunders which proceed out of the throne. These represent neither the ‘outpouring of the Holy Spirit’ nor the ‘agency of the Gospel,’ but the fact that the throne of God is a throne of judgment (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+9:7">Psalms 9:7</span>). The world is judged not merely by God Himself, but by His Church (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:27">Revelation 2:27</span>). Judgment against sin is a necessary accompaniment both of holiness and love. Nor need it surprise us that such indications of judgment should proceed from the throne at a time when the Church is regarded as having attained her glorified condition, and is safe from all her enemies, for it is not so much the actual exercise as the attribute of judgment that is now in view, and such an attribute is eternal. These lightnings and voices and thunders, therefore, are not to be regarded as a manifestation peculiar to the moment at which they are witnessed by the Seer: they are essential and perpetual accompaniments of the throne. In addition there were <strong> seven torches of fire burning before the throne,</strong> which are explained to be the <strong> seven spirits of God,</strong> or, in other words, His one Spirit in the fulness and manifoldness of His operation. Yet it is not the gracious operation of the Spirit by which God calls enlightens, and sanctifies the world that is in view. It is rather His penetrating influence, similar to that of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+1:14">Revelation 1:14</span>, by which He searches the innermost recesses of the heart.
