<p>Chaps. 4 and 5 form the third section of the Apocalypse; but the struggle of the Church, which it is the main object of the book to describe, does not yet begin. These two chapters are preparatory to the struggle, presenting us with such pictures of the glory of the heavenly Guardians of the Church as may fill our minds with confidence that, whatever be her trials, she shall be conducted through them to a glorious issue. As the foundation of all that God is, has done, and will do, St. John receives in chap. 4 a vision of His absolute holiness, which is borne witness to by His Church, and by the whole of His redeemed creation. This is followed in chap. 5 by another vision, from which it appears that the mystery connected with the dealings of the thrice holy One (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+4:8">Revelation 4:8</span>) shall not last for ever. In Immanuel, the Incarnate Lamb of God, the mystery otherwise so oppressive shall be made manifest; and our hearts may be at peace. The visions of these two chapters have their parallel in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:0">Isaiah 6:0</span>, where the vision of the thrice holy God presented to the prophet (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+4:1-8">Revelation 4:1-8</span>) is introductory to his terrible commission at <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+4:9">Revelation 4:9</span>. Isaiah is warned by his vision that the Almighty, notwithstanding the mystery of His dealings, is holy, and that the beings who see what He is doing cannot but adore Him.
