<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+5:12">Revelation 5:12</span>. <strong> Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slaughtered to take the power, and riches and wisdom and might and honour and glory and blessing.</strong> It will be observed that one article is connected with ‘power’ alone, thus showing that this power stands in a <em> </em> conception by itself, and that the other parts of the doxology are added for the sake of enlarging the idea, so constituting one whole (comp. note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:6">John 14:6</span>). The thought of ‘the power’ then is no doubt prominent, either because ‘reigning’ had been spoken of immediately before, or, as has been suggested, because of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+5:3">Revelation 5:3</span>. No one was ‘able,’ had power, to open the roll, but the Lamb overcame, so as to open it This power belongs essentially to the Lamb, and He takes it to Himself (comp. on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+4:11">Revelation 4:11</span>). The other things ascribed to Him follow as parts of the Messianic kingdom, the kingdom of redemption; and it may be noticed that all, taken together, make up the sacred number seven. The chorus is now still further enlarged.
