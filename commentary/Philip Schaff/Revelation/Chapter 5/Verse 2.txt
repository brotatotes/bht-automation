Revelation 5:2. The  angel of this verse is strong, and his  voice is great, because his cry has to be heard in every region of the universe, in heaven, in earth, and in Hades (comp. chap. Revelation 10:3). that an ‘angel’ raises the cry may remind us of the interest taken by angels in the plan of redemption and in the fortunes of the Church (comp 1 Peter 1:12). At the same time, it may be nothing more than a part of that imagery of this book of which we have already spoken (see on Revelation 1:20).
