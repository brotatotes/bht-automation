<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+5:2">Revelation 5:2</span>. The <strong> angel</strong> of this verse is strong, and his <strong> voice is great,</strong> because his cry has to be heard in every region of the universe, in heaven, in earth, and in Hades (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+10:3">Revelation 10:3</span>). that an ‘angel’ raises the cry may remind us of the interest taken by angels in the plan of redemption and in the fortunes of the Church (comp <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:12">1 Peter 1:12</span>). At the same time, it may be nothing more than a part of that imagery of this book of which we have already spoken (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20">Revelation 1:20</span>).
