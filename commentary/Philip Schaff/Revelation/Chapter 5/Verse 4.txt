Revelation 5:4.  And I wept much. There is nothing in this weeping inconsistent with the fact that a revelation had been promised (chap. Revelation 4:1). That promise is already in course of being fulfilled; but the Seer does not know how far it is to extend. Therefore he weep because he fears that the revelation may be already about to close. Besides this, there is nothing unnatural in the supposition that the promise may not at this instant have been clearly present to his mind. He is completely rapt away by what is before his eyes. One, however, there is who is worthy to do what no other creature can.
