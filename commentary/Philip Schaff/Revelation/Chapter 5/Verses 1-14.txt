<p>The vision upon which we enter in this chapter is beheld in the same circumstances as that of chap. 4, and is closely connected with it. The special revelation of the Apocalypse does not yet begin, and the Seer is still prepared for it in the same manner as in the immediately preceding vision. At the same time, the chapter before us is to be considered as introductory not only to the seven Seals (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+6:1">Revelation 6:1</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+8:1">Revelation 8:1</span>) but to the whole of the main portion of the book. It thus presents us with a picture of the heavenly guardianship exercised over the Church by God as a redeeming God, or rather by that risen and glorified Saviour who is her protector in every trial, and the solution of all her difficulties. In the last vision we beheld God as the Creator and Governor of all things. In this we behold Him who, when already slaughtered and risen, can say, ‘All authority hath been given unto Me in heaven and on earth’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:18">Matthew 28:18</span>). The two visions, taken together, may be regarded as a commentary on the words of Jesus in His last discourse to His disciples, ‘Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God, believe also in Me’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:1">John 14:1</span>). By means of both the mind is calmed in the prospect of the approaching troubles of the Church. Before she enters upon them we know that hers shall be the victory.
