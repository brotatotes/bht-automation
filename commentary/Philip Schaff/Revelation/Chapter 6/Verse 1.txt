<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+6:1">Revelation 6:1</span>. <strong> And I saw. </strong> This word ‘saw’ is to be taken <strong> </strong> absolutely, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+6:2">Revelation 6:2</span>, where it is repeated.

<p><strong> when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals. </strong> We have no right to translate the original word for ‘one’ in this and also in the next clause, by the words ‘the first’ At chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+4:7">Revelation 4:7</span>, where the living creatures are described, the proper expressions for the first, the second, the third, and the fourth are used. Whether, therefore, the living creatures now meet us in one same order as that in which they are mentioned there, it is hardly possible to say. The probability is that they do; out that alone will not entitle us to find a special connection between each of the four and the vision introduced in answer to its ‘cry,’ as if the lion called for subjugation, the bull-calf for sacrificial slaughter, the man for mourning, and the eagle for tearing the prey. It is enough to say that the visions are introduced with peculiar propriety as an answer to the cry of the living creatures. These beings represent redeemed creation, and it is upon the world that judgment is to fall. This last consideration also shows us that it is a mistake to imagine that the living creatures are mentioned because they are connected with a throne of grace. They are emblems of judgment, not of grace (see on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+4:7">Revelation 4:7</span>); and judgment is about to be executed. The living creature cries ‘Come,’ not ‘Come and see.’ In the latter case the cry would be addressed to the Seer. It is really addressed to Jesus (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+22:17">Revelation 22:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+22:20">Revelation 22:20</span>). The cry is answered.
