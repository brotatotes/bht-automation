<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+6:11">Revelation 6:11</span>. To the cry of these martyred souls an answer is given both by deed and word. By deed; for <strong> a</strong> white robe, denoting the purity of saints perfected in Christ, was bestowed on each of them (comp. chaps, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+3:5">Revelation 3:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+4:4">Revelation 4:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+7:9">Revelation 7:9</span>). This robe is the garment of <em> all </em> who overcome, another indication that <em> all </em> such, and not martyrs only, are included in the souls underneath the altar. To this act of grace words are added, telling them that they must rest a little space until their fellow-servants of the New Testament Dispensation shall be completed, and all the children of God shall be gathered together, ‘no wanderer lost, a family in heaven.’
