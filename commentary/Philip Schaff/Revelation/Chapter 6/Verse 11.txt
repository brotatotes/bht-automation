Revelation 6:11. To the cry of these martyred souls an answer is given both by deed and word. By deed; for  a white robe, denoting the purity of saints perfected in Christ, was bestowed on each of them (comp. chaps, Revelation 3:5, Revelation 4:4, Revelation 7:9). This robe is the garment of  all  who overcome, another indication that  all  such, and not martyrs only, are included in the souls underneath the altar. To this act of grace words are added, telling them that they must rest a little space until their fellow-servants of the New Testament Dispensation shall be completed, and all the children of God shall be gathered together, ‘no wanderer lost, a family in heaven.’
