<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+6:2">Revelation 6:2</span>. All the figures of this verse are those of victory, the horse and its whiteness, the crown, and the distinct statement at the close of the verse (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:11">Revelation 19:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:14">Revelation 19:14</span>). The bow <strong> </strong> expresses the fact that the Conqueror sees and strikes down His enemies from afar.

<p>The great question is, Who is this rider? On the one hand it might seem as if it cannot be the Lord Himself, for how in that case shall we preserve a perfect parallelism between the first vision and the three that follow it? Can Christ be named in the same category with War, Famine, and Pestilence? On the other hand, if it be not the Lord, how shall we draw a line of distinction between the first and the second vision? Both will symbolize war. Besides which, the last words of the verse to conquer so clearly point to complete and permanent victory that it is difficult to limit them to any lower object than the triumphant Saviour. In the Old Testament, too, the judgments of God are three, not four, in number, ‘the sword, the famine, and the pestilence’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eze+6:11">Ezekiel 6:11</span>, etc.), exactly those found in the three following riders. We are thus led to see here our Lord in His cause and kingdom ‘riding prosperously (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:0">Psalms 45:0</span>), because of truth and meekness and righteousness, His arrows sharp in the heart of His enemies, and His right hand teaching them terrible things.’ It is His kingdom, first in Himself and then in His people, who are one with Him and in Him, that passes before the Seer’s eye, a kingdom which shall yet prevail over every adversary. By looking at the matter in this light we preserve the analogy of the four riders, not one of whom is strictly speaking a person, while at the same time we render full justice to each part of the figure. ‘Wars’ and ‘famines and pestilences’ are foretold in the same order by our Lord in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:6-7">Matthew 24:6-7</span>.
