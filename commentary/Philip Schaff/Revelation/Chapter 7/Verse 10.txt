<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+7:10">Revelation 7:10</span>. <strong> They cry with a great voice,</strong> a voice expressing the intensity of their thankfulness and joy, and in their cry they attribute the glory of their salvation to Him whom they describe as our God which sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb. To this psalm of praise which, as shown by the use of the present tense ‘cry,’ is sung unceasingly, a choral response is immediately given.
