<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+7:13">Revelation 7:13</span>. <em> </em> <strong> These which are arrayed in white robes, who are they, and whence came they? </strong> The question is not asked by the Seer. It is Addressed to him in order that his attention may be drawn to it with greater force, and one of the elders is the speaker. In chap, vi the four living creatures spoke, because they represented creation, and were the instruments of vengeance. Now one of the elders speaks, because the elders represent the triumphant Church.
