<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+7:9">Revelation 7:9</span>. The vision now introduced is distinguished from the former by the fact that it belongs to heaven, while the sealing took place on earth. Those beheld stand <strong> before the throne and before the</strong> <strong> Lamb </strong> (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+4:5-6">Revelation 4:5-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+4:10">Revelation 4:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+5:8">Revelation 5:8</span>, etc.), and the other particulars correspond. They are <strong> clothed with white robes</strong>, emblematic of priestly purity. They have <strong> palms in their hands,</strong> not palms of victory at heathen games, but palms of festive joy, especially of the least of Tabernacles. The whole scene appears to be modelled upon that of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:12">John 12:12</span>, etc., even the great multitude here reminding us of that mentioned there.

<p>This great multitude is out of every nation, the word ‘nation’ being then enlarged and supplemented. The terms used are four, an indication of the universality of the host. But not Gentile Christians alone are included; Jewish Christians must also be referred to; a fact throwing a reflex light upon the vision of the sealing, and confirming the conclusion already reached, that the 144,000 are not to be confined to the latter class. Nor does the statement that this is a multitude which no man could number prove that it is a larger company than the 144,000, for these figures are to be understood not numerically, but symbolically and theologically.
