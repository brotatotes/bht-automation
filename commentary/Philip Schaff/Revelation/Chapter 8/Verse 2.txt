Revelation 8:2. The  seven angels  spoken of stand before God ready to execute His will. It is implied that this is their usual position, and not merely that they are there for the moment.
	 And there were given unto them seven trumpets. These trumpets are neither those of festal proclamation, nor are they, with some recent commentators, to be regarded as a mere ‘manifestation of will.’ They are trumpets of war and battle, like those whose sound brought down the walls of Jericho, or those whose blast struck terror into the hosts of Midian (Judges 7:22). This alone is sufficient to show us that in them we have an advance upon the seals. The seals only announce judgment. The trumpets indicate action, which at the same time they arouse and quicken.
