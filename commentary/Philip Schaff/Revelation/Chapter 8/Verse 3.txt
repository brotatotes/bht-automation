Revelation 8:3. As   we are here at a higher stage of judgment than before, a greater amount of preparation is made for it. Hence the second angel appears. Who this, called  another angel, was we are not informed. But, when we compare chap. Revelation 10:1 (see note), we shall probably conclude that, though not actually our Lord Himself, he is a representation of Him. He is distinctly pointed to as the Mediator of the prayers of the saints, and to Him all judgment is committed. Christ’s place, too, as our High Priest, is  by the altar. Commentators have felt much difficulty in determining which of the two altars of the Tabernacle is referred to in the verse before us as ‘the altar,’ and whether we are to distinguish between it and that afterwards spoken of in the same verse as the  golden altar which was before the throne. Upon the whole the probability seems to be that they are the same, the difference of expression depending upon the fact that the fuller description is given when the special purpose of the altar is more particularly alluded to. At Revelation 8:5, where we have again the simple designation ‘the altar,’ it is hardly possible to think of any other than the golden altar or the altar of incense. Beside this altar then the angel appears standing with  a  golden censer.  Much incense is  given him that he should  add it unto the prayers of all the saints, so that the prayers and the incense might ascend together, a memorial before God of the trials and sufferings of His people. These prayers are obviously those of the suffering Church; and they are offered, not that she may be prepared to meet the coming judgments, but that she may hasten them (comp. Luke 18:7-8). It is clear that both in this verse, and throughout the passage, we are dealing not with any select company of believers, or with martyrs in the ordinary sense of that term, but with the whole Church of Christ conceived of as being in a martyr state.
