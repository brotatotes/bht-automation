<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+8:6">Revelation 8:6</span>. The prayers of the suffering Church have been heard, and the answer is to be given. Hence we are told in this verse that the <strong> seven angels prepared themselves to sound.</strong> The words are, strictly speaking, a part neither of the seventh seal nor of the first trumpet. They mark a transition point, preparatory to the latter.
