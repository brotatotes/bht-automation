<p>The first four Trumpets are evidently separated from the three which follow them <strong> ,</strong> both by the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+8:13">Revelation 8:13</span> and by the fact that they refer to things of earth, while in the latter we are brought into contact with the spiritual world. A transition of a similar kind met us at the opening of the fifth Seal in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+6:9">Revelation 6:9</span>, and the correspondence, in a book constructed upon so symmetrical a plan as the Apocalypse, is sufficient to show us that the transition is in both cases designed.
