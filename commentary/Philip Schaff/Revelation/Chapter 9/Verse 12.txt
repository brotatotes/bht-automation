<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+9:12">Revelation 9:12</span>. We are now at a higher stage of judgment than in the seals. More solemnity therefore befits the occasion. At the close of the fifth seal we passed directly to the sixth: not so now. The Seer interposes with the warning, The one woe is passed; behold, there come yet two woes hereafter.
