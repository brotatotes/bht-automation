<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+9:19">Revelation 9:19</span>. The description of the horses is resumed, for the purpose of bringing out another terrible feature of their destructive power. That power is also <strong> in their tails, for their tails are like unto serpents, having heads, and with them they do hurt.</strong> Three characteristics of the tails are specially mentioned; first, they are ‘like unto serpents,’ long, smooth, subtle, clasping their victim in an embrace from which he cannot escape; secondly, they ‘have heads’ at the extremity farthest from the body; where the power of an ordinary tail ceases these tails receive increased intensity of power, the glittering eye, the poison fang; thirdly, with them, that is, with the heads, they ‘do hurt.’ The tail of a horse is for its own protection: these tails devastate. Yet they are not so fatal as the mouths. The former ‘hurt,’ the latter ‘kill.’
