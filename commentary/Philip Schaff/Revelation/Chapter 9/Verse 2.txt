Revelation 9:2. No sooner was the well opened than  there went up a smoke out of the well as the smoke of a great furnace. The smoke must be thought of as so thick and black that the sun was shrouded from view and the whole air darkened. It is hardly necessary to remind the reader that-darkness is the note of Satan’s kingdom as light is of Christ’s (comp. Ephesians 6:12, where Satan and his angels are called ‘the world-rulers of this   darkness’).
