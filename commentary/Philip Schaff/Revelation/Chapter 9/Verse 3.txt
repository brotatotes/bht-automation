Revelation 9:3.  Out of the smoke, we  are  next told,  there came forth locusts into  the earth. We  need not ask whether these locusts came out of the well, or only out of the smoke after it reached the surface of the earth. The latter is all that the Seer beholds, but it cannot be doubted that he looks upon the plague as demoniacal in its origin. The locusts are compared with locusts of the earth, and they have  given unto them  the frightful power of destruction belonging to the latter. The idea of the plague is no doubt taken in the first instance from the Egyptian plague of the same kind (Exodus 10:14-15); but a similar image of terrible and irresistible destruction  is  frequently employed by the prophets (Psalms 105:34; Jeremiah 46:23; and especially Joel 2:1-2).
