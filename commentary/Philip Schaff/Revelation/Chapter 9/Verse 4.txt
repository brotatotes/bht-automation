<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+9:4">Revelation 9:4</span>. In one respect, indeed, there is <strong> a </strong> remarkable distinction between the ravages of the locusts mentioned here and those of the common locusts of the earth. <strong> Grass</strong> and trees and all green things are what the last lay desolate, but such things these locusts are forbidden to touch. It was said unto them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; and the prohibition may be so given in order to bring out, more strongly than would otherwise be done, the singleness with which their rage is directed against <em> men,, </em> as well as the degree to which that rage is increased by want of their ordinary food. Not all men, however, but only such men as have not the seal of God on their foreheads, are to be smitten by the plague; and the inference, in its bearing on the interpretation of the sealing in chap, 7, ought not to pass unnoticed. If we confine the sealing to the tribes of Israel, it will be impossible to extend the locust plague beyond that limit; yet no one will contend for such a view.
