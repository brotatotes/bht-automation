Revelation 9:6. So terrible is the plague that men shall eagerly, but in vain, desire to die a point reached under the  sixth  seal, but now under the  fifth  trumpet, the usual climax of the Apocalypse. Before passing on it may be well to notice the remarkable double reference to the book of Job in these verses. There, as here in Revelation 9:5, Satan was restrained when the patriarch was delivered into his hands (Job 2:6). There, as here, the smitten one longed to die (Job 3:11; Job 3:20-21). This double reference must be considered as conclusive upon the point that Job is in the Apostleâ€™s eye; and, if so, nothing more is needed to convince us that the locust-plague is demoniacal not earthly in its origin.
