<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+9:6">Revelation 9:6</span>. So terrible is the plague that men shall eagerly, but in vain, desire to die a point reached under the <em> sixth </em> seal, but now under the <em> fifth </em> trumpet, the usual climax of the Apocalypse. Before passing on it may be well to notice the remarkable double reference to the book of Job in these verses. There, as here in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+9:5">Revelation 9:5</span>, Satan was restrained when the patriarch was delivered into his hands (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="job+2:6">Job 2:6</span>). There, as here, the smitten one longed to die (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="job+3:11">Job 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="job+3:20-21">Job 3:20-21</span>). This double reference must be considered as conclusive upon the point that Job is in the Apostleâ€™s eye; and, if so, nothing more is needed to convince us that the locust-plague is demoniacal not earthly in its origin.
