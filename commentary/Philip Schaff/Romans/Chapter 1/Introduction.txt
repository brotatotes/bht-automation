<p><strong> Address, Introduction, and Theme
	</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.24em;"> Chapter 1 contains two distinct parts: <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1-17">Romans 1:1-17</span> form the introductory portion of the Epistle; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18-32">Romans 1:18-32</span> give the proof that the Gentiles need the gospel from the fact of their sinfulness exposing them to the wrath of God. (This statement is the first half of the first main division of the doctrinal part of the Epistle. See Introduction §3, in the Romans Book Comments and notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18">Romans 1:18</span>.) We divide <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1-17">Romans 1:1-17</span> into three sections: <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1-7">Romans 1:1-7</span> contain the <em> Address and Greeting</em> (in an unusually full form); <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:8-15">Romans 1:8-15</span> constitute the <em> Introduction</em> proper, since they give the occasion for this Apostle’s writing to the Roman Christians; by an easy transition he then passes to the Main Theme of the Epistle, which is stated in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>, and further explained in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>.
