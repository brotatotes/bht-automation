<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>. <strong> Paul. </strong> See <em> Gen. Introd.</em>, § 1, and Acts throughout.

<p><strong> A servant of Jesus Christ. </strong> The word ‘servant’ here means ‘bondman,’ expressing the fact that Paul personally belonged to Jesus Christ, rather than the idea of service in His behalf. Another word conveys the latter sense. Any unpleasant thought connected with the former idea is removed by the character of the Master, Jesus Christ. This term of humility and dependence is the most honorable of all titles.
	</p>
<p><strong> Called to be an Apostle. </strong> Here he simply asserts the fact of his apostolic dignity and authority; in writing to the Galatians, he was forced to defend his apostleship (comp. the enlarged description of the word in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:1">Galatians 1:1</span>). He received the call on the way to Damascus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:15">Acts 9:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:17">Acts 26:17</span>); his call coincided with his conversion; it was confirmed in the temple at Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:28">Acts 9:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17-21">Acts 22:17-21</span>). His setting apart at Antioch (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2-3">Acts 13:2-3</span>) was not the call, but a formal recognition of the call on the part of the Church there, and for a special mission. The title is an official one, and while it might at first refer to any messenger, in the early Church it was soon restricted to the Twelve and to Paul, as chosen witnesses of the resurrection, selected to lay the foundation of the Christian Church. Paul was not one of the Twelve, but represented the independent apostolate of the Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span>). As preachers and missionaries the Apostles must have successors, but as inspired and authoritative witnesses for Christ, called <em> directly </em> by him for the <em> whole </em> world, they have none.
	</p>
<p><strong> Set apart. </strong> This explains the apostleship. Paul was selected from the world, singled out, consecrated to, and destined for the gospel service. In one sense this took place at is birth (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:15">Galatians 1:15</span>, where the same word occurs); but the reference here is probably to the call to be an Apostle, especially as the tense used is not the same as in Galatians, but points to a past act with a continuous result.
	</p>
<p><strong> Unto the gospel of God. </strong> This was that for which he was set apart. The gospel is ‘of God,’ having Him as its author; it is about Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:3-4">Romans 1:3-4</span>).
