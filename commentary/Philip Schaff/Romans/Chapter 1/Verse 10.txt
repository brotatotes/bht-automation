Romans 1:10.  Making request.  How unceasingly he remembers them is evident from this constant petition, the purport of which is next expressed.
	 If haply,  etc. Instead of saying, ‘that I may come,’ the Apostle uses this conditional form, which indicates both his earnest desire and his submission of it to God’s will.
	 How at last,  on some occasion. This implies both earnest wish and long delay (both of which are expressed in Romans 1:13), and also the possibility that he might be delayed much longer. Three years intervened before his desire was granted.
	 I may be prospered.  The E. V. here follows the incorrect trans-ion of the Vulgate. The word means to succeed, to have the good fortune; the idea of journeying, which belonged to it originally, was lost in the usage of that time.
	 By the will of God.  This belongs to ‘prospered,’ not to ‘come.’ Romans 1:11.  For I long to see you.  This longing was the reason of his constant petition. There is no needless repetition, since this verse and what follows show that thanksgiving, remembrance, petition, and longing, all grow out of his desire to preach that gospel, which he is about to set forth in this Epistle.
	 Some spiritual gift.  ‘Spiritual’ means, wrought by the Holy Spirit, and not simply, belonging to the inner lift. Apparently, Paul never uses the word in the latter sense. ‘Gift’ does not refer to miraculous gifts, but to all gifts of grace. ‘Some,’ expresses ‘not only the Apostle’s modesty, but an acknowledgment that the Romans were already in the faith, together with an intimation that something was still wanting in them.’ (Lange.)
	 To the end,  etc. This was the object of the desired impartation of spiritual gifts; they were not desired for their own sake.
	 Be established,  or, ‘strengthened.’ The agent would be the Holy Spirit (comp. ‘spiritual’); Paul was but the instrument (see next verse).
