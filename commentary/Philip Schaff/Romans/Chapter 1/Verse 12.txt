Romans 1:12.  That is,  etc. ‘By this modifying explanation, subjoined with humility, and expressed in a delicate complimentary manner, Paul guards himself, in the presence of a church to which he was still a stranger, from the possible appearance of presumption and of forming too low an estimate of the Christian position of his readers.’ (Meyer.)
	 I with you may be comforted among  or, ‘in,’ you.   The phrase is difficult to translate; since in the original there is a compound verb which means ‘comforted with,’  i.e.,  at the same time with, and also an added phrase, which means ‘among you,’ lit, ‘in you.’ The full meaning is: that he might be comforted,  i.e.,  encouraged and helped, as these ideas are included in the New Testament use of the word, at the same time when they were, namely, when by the fulfilment of his purpose, he should be ‘among them.’ The literal sense ‘in you’ is preferred by some as indicating that the comfort was found in them; but the next phrase designates the source of the comfort.
	 Each of us,  etc. The translation we adopt is now generally accepted. (‘Mutual faith’ suggests the incorrect sense, that the faith they had was faith in each other.) This turn of the thought indicates that their faith is the same, that they can, therefore, help and comfort one another; the closing expression shows tact and modesty. One can scarcely fail to remark how the tone of Paul differs from that of the Roman Popes.
