<p><strong> As much as in me is</strong>, or,’ as far as in me lies.’ The phrase is a strong one, as if to say: ‘As far as it depends on me, I am anxious to come and preach to you, but my will is subject to the will of God, who may have decreed it otherwise;’ comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:10">Romans 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:13">Romans 1:13</span>.

<p><strong> I am ready. </strong> This is a correct paraphrase of a difficult Greek expression.
	</p>
<p><strong> To preach the gospel. </strong> One word in the original, to evangelize.
	</p>
<p><strong> To you also that are in Rome. </strong> The Christians in Rome are meant here, as throughout. The gospel, which they had already heard from others, he was ready to preach to them, that he might have fruit among them also (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:13">Romans 1:13</span>). To refer it to unconverted Romans is incorrect, both because of the use of ‘you’ in what precedes, and because his readiness to preach this gospel to those who had already received it is the warrant for <em> writing it </em> to believers. Emphasis rests upon ‘you also in Rome.’ It was the capital of the world; even there he would not be ‘ashamed of the gospel’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>). ‘Paul subsequently attained the object of his wishes, though not according to human purposes, but according to the counsel of God: first as a prisoner, and last as a martyr’ (Lange). The very same power is required to make men missionaries as to make them martyrs.
