Romans 1:19.  Because.  Here begins the statement  why  God’s wrath was revealed, which is also a proof that they hold back the truth in unrighteousness. ‘If they did so out of ignorance, they would be excusable: but they do not do so out of ignorance, and  therefore  God’s wrath is manifested against them’ (Meyer). The Apostle proves first that men had the truth (Romans 1:19-20); then that they hindered it, and perverted it (Romans 1:21-23). Afterwards the result is described.
	 That which is known of God.  The word used has this sense in the New Testament; so that the phrase does not mean the knowledge of God, nor what may be known of God. The former is un-grammatical, the latter illogical in this connection, since it is plainly shown that the heathen did not know all that may be known of God.
	 In them; not, ‘among them,’ which would refer to a merely external revelation. The Apostle is speaking of a revelation in the heart and conscience.
	 God manifested it.  Through the creation (Romans 1:20); the tense used pointing to one act.
