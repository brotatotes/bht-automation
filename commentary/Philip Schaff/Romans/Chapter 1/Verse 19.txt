<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:19">Romans 1:19</span>. <strong> Because. </strong> Here begins the statement <em> why </em> God’s wrath was revealed, which is also a proof that they hold back the truth in unrighteousness. ‘If they did so out of ignorance, they would be excusable: but they do not do so out of ignorance, and <em> therefore </em> God’s wrath is manifested against them’ (Meyer). The Apostle proves first that men had the truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:19-20">Romans 1:19-20</span>); then that they hindered it, and perverted it (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:21-23">Romans 1:21-23</span>). Afterwards the result is described.

<p><strong> That which is known of God. </strong> The word used has this sense in the New Testament; so that the phrase does not mean the knowledge of God, nor what may be known of God. The former is un-grammatical, the latter illogical in this connection, since it is plainly shown that the heathen did not know all that may be known of God.
	</p>
<p><strong> In them</strong>; not, ‘among them,’ which would refer to a merely external revelation. The Apostle is speaking of a revelation in the heart and conscience.
	</p>
<p><strong> God manifested it. </strong> Through the creation (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span>); the tense used pointing to one act.
