Romans 1:21.  Because.  The fact which renders them inexcusable is now stated.

	 Nor give thanks;  i.e., did not praise Him for all his benefits.
	 Became vain in their thoughts.  ‘Imaginations’ is inexact; ‘thoughts,’ discussions, reasonings, are meant (comp. chap. Romans 2:15).’ The conceptions, ideas, and reflections, which they formed for themselves regarding the Deity, were wholly devoid of any intrinsic value corresponding with the truth’ (Meyer.) ‘Vanity’ is a characteristic term for idol-worship; Deuteronomy 32:21; 2 Kings 17:5; Jeremiah 2:5; Acts 14:15.

	 Heart.  Here, as so often in the Bible, this refers to the whole inner man.
