Having shown that the heathen had the truth and held it back in unrighteousness, the Apostle now shows  how  God’s wrath was displayed: generally in giving them up to uncleanness (Romans 1:24-25), and specially to unnatural sensuality (Romans 1:26-27), as well as to other vices which are named (Romans 1:28-32).
	 Gave them up.  This is more than ‘permitted.’ That sin is punished by sin, we are taught by the Bible and by daily experience.
