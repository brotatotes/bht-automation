<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Exchanged. </strong> A stronger phrase than that in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:23">Romans 1:23</span>.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> The truth of God.</strong> The truth or reality of God, the true Divine essence, practically the same as ‘the true God.’ The latter phrase would perhaps seem irreverent. Other views, the true knowledge of God, the true notion of God, etc., are less in keeping with the figure of exchanging.

The word rendered ‘blessed’ is applied, in the Bible, only to God; a different one is used of man, in the Psalms, Sermon on the Mount, etc.
