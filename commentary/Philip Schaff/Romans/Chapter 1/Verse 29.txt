<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:29">Romans 1:29</span>. <strong> Being filled with all unrighteousness. </strong> This is a general statement, the specifications follow. (Comp. similar catalogues of sins; noted in marg. references to this verse.) Various ingenious attempts have been made at classifying the list; but the Apostle seems to have had in mind rhetorical effect, rather than systematic order, the design being to bring out more strikingly the absolute need of redemption. (The word ‘fornication’ is omitted by the best authorities; and after <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:26-27">Romans 1:26-27</span>, the naming of this vice seems inappropriate.)
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Wickedness; </strong> disposition to accomplish evil; the adjective is applied to Satan.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Covetousness</strong>; this sin is emphasized in the New Testament (see especially <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:3">Ephesians 5:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:5">Ephesians 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:5">Colossians 3:5</span>), and was widespread, at that time, in the Roman world.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Maliciousness </strong> in the classical sense is idleness as opposed to virtue.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Envy</strong>. Conceived here as the <em> thought </em> which has filled the man.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Murder. </strong> The similarity in sound of the original words may have led to the mention of this sin first here; but ‘envy’ and ‘murder’ are related.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Strife. </strong> The word is that applied to the goddess of Discord.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Whisperers; </strong> secret slanderers, tale-bearers. (This word ought to be placed in the next verse.)
