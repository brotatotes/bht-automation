Romans 1:3.  Concerning his Bon.  The punctuation of the E. V. connects this with the word ‘gospel’ (Romans 1:1), but it may be joined with Romans 1:2: God’s previous promise in the Old Testament was concerning His Son. That promise was fulfilled in the gospel. In any case it is fairly implied that the ‘Son’ existed in a   peculiar relation to God, before the historical manifestations described in the two parallel clauses which follow. These clauses each contain three contrasted members: (1) was born, (2) of the seed of David, (3) according to the flesh; (1) was declared to be the Son of God with power, (2) by resurrection of the dead, (3) according to the Spirit of holiness.
	 Who was born. Though He was the Son of God, it was necessary for the fulfilment of the Messianic promises that He should appear as  man,  hence He was born.
	 Of the need of David.  This too was in fulfilment of the promise. On the question whether this refers to Mary as   well as Joseph, see vol. i., pp. 29, 367.
	 According to  the flesh,  i.e., according to His human nature, or descent. The word ‘flesh’ is also used of our sinful nature, but that sense is excluded here, since He appeared ‘in the likeness of the flesh of sin’ (see on chap. Romans 8:3). Nor does the phrase refer to the body alone, or to the body and soul, distinguished from the spirit ‘Were He a   mere man, it had been enough to say that He was of the seed of David; but as He is more than man, it was necessary to limit His descent from David to His human nature’ (Hodge).
