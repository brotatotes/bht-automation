Romans 1:30.  Backbiters; open slanderers, or calumniators.
	 Hateful to God; or, as in the E. V., ‘haters of God.’ The former sense is the classical one; the latter is supposed to be more in accordance with the Biblical view of God. ‘Leaving the word in its strict signification,  hated of God,  we recognize in it a  summary judgment of moral indignation respecting all the preceding particulars;  so that, looking back   on   these, it forms a resting-point in the disgraceful catalogue’ (Meyer). This suits the connection better: ‘If any crime was known more than another, as “hated by the gods,” it was that of  informers,  abandoned persons who circumvented and ruined others by a system of malignant espionage and false information’(Alford).
	 Insolent, haughty, boasters; three terms applying to self-exaltation, the last the least offensive.
	 Disobedient to parents. ‘ Apostasy from the piety and affection due to parents is a fountain of corruption. See Malachi 4:6; Luke 1:17 ’ (Lange).
