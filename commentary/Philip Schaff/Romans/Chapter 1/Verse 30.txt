<p><strong> Hateful to God</strong>; or, as in the E. V., ‘haters of God.’ The former sense is the classical one; the latter is supposed to be more in accordance with the Biblical view of God. ‘Leaving the word in its strict signification, <em> hated of God, </em> we recognize in it a <em> summary judgment of moral indignation respecting all the preceding particulars; </em> so that, looking back <strong> </strong> on <strong> </strong> these, it forms a resting-point in the disgraceful catalogue’ (Meyer). This suits the connection better: ‘If any crime was known more than another, as “hated by the gods,” it was that of <em> informers, </em> abandoned persons who circumvented and ruined others by a system of malignant espionage and false information’(Alford).

<p><strong> Insolent, haughty, boasters</strong>; three terms applying to self-exaltation, the last the least offensive.

<p><strong> Disobedient to parents. ‘</strong> Apostasy from the piety and affection due to parents is a fountain of corruption. See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:6">Malachi 4:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:17">Luke 1:17</span> ’ (Lange).
