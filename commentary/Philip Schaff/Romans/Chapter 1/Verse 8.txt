Romans 1:8.  First of all.  Some find the second thought in Romans 1:10, or Romans 1:13; others translate ‘chiefly.’ As the absence of ‘secondly’ suggests a   slight emphasis, we render as   above (comp. chap. Romans 3:2).
	 I thank my God.  (See introductory note). ‘The Apostle pursues the natural course of first placing himself, so to speak, in relation with his readers; and his first point of contact with them is gratitude for their participation in Christianity’ (De Wette). There is a   touching emphasis in the phrase ‘my God’ with its personal appropriation and corresponding sense of personal obligation. In this expression he sums up ‘all those experiences he had  personally  made’ (Godet) of the covenant faithfulness of God.
	 Through Jesus Christ.  The thanksgiving is through Chris; comp. Hebrews 3:15. and similar passages. Jesus Christ is also the medium through whom came the blessings for which he is thankful; but the other thought is the prominent one.
	 For you all.  The thanksgiving was concerning them, or, on their behalf.
	 That.  The word also means ‘because;’ but here the two senses are practically the same.
	Y  our faith is published,  declared among Christians. That the Roman church was   comparatively unknown to unbelievers, even to the Jews at Rome, appears from Acts 28:22. The praiseworthy character of their faith may be inferred from the thanksgiving.
	 In the whole world. A  popular hyperbole, but how accordant with the position of the church in  that  city, toward which the eyes of the whole world were turned!’ (Meyer.)
