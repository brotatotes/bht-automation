<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:8">Romans 1:8</span>. <strong> First of all. </strong> Some find the second thought in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:10">Romans 1:10</span>, or <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:13">Romans 1:13</span>; others translate ‘chiefly.’ As the absence of ‘secondly’ suggests a <strong> </strong> slight emphasis, we render as <strong> </strong> above (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:2">Romans 3:2</span>).

<p><strong> I thank my God. </strong> (See introductory note). ‘The Apostle pursues the natural course of first placing himself, so to speak, in relation with his readers; and his first point of contact with them is gratitude for their participation in Christianity’ (De Wette). There is a <strong> </strong> touching emphasis in the phrase ‘my God’ with its personal appropriation and corresponding sense of personal obligation. In this expression he sums up ‘all those experiences he had <em> personally </em> made’ (Godet) of the covenant faithfulness of God.
	</p>
<p><strong> Through Jesus Christ. </strong> The thanksgiving is through Chris; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:15">Hebrews 3:15</span>. and similar passages. Jesus Christ is also the medium through whom came the blessings for which he is thankful; but the other thought is the prominent one.
	</p>
<p><strong> For you all. </strong> The thanksgiving was concerning them, or, on their behalf.
	</p>
<p><strong> That. </strong> The word also means ‘because;’ but here the two senses are practically the same.
	</p>
<p>Y <strong> our faith is published, </strong> declared among Christians. That the Roman church was <strong> </strong> comparatively unknown to unbelievers, even to the Jews at Rome, appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:22">Acts 28:22</span>. The praiseworthy character of their faith may be inferred from the thanksgiving.
	</p>
<p><strong> In the whole world. A </strong> popular hyperbole, but how accordant with the position of the church in <em> that </em> city, toward which the eyes of the whole world were turned!’ (Meyer.)
