 Introduction,  Giving the Occasion of the Epistle.
	After the full and formal address and greeting, the Apostle, as usual, begins with thanksgiving on behalf of the Christians addressed. (In Galatians a rebuke takes the place of the thanksgiving.) Here Paul gives thanks, and that through Jesus Christ, for the extended fame of the faith of the Christians at Rome (Romans 1:8), and then mentions his constant prayer for them (Romans 1:9), and especially his prayerful desire to come to them (Romans 1:10), for their common edification (Romans 1:11-12). His unfulfilled purpose to come that he might have fruit among them also (Romans 1:13), grows out of his obligation to preach the gospel to all men (Romans 1:14), hence his readiness to preach to them also (Romans 1:15). The non-fulfilment of this desire and purpose occasioned the Epistle, the main thought of which immediately follows (Romans 1:16-17).
