<p><em> Introduction</em>, <em> Giving the Occasion of the Epistle</em>.
	</p>
<p>After the full and formal address and greeting, the Apostle, as usual, begins with thanksgiving on behalf of the Christians addressed. (In Galatians a rebuke takes the place of the thanksgiving.) Here Paul gives thanks, and that through Jesus Christ, for the extended fame of the faith of the Christians at Rome (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:8">Romans 1:8</span>), and then mentions his constant prayer for them (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:9">Romans 1:9</span>), and especially his prayerful desire to come to them (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:10">Romans 1:10</span>), for their common edification (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:11-12">Romans 1:11-12</span>). His unfulfilled purpose to come that he might have fruit among them also (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:13">Romans 1:13</span>), grows out of his obligation to preach the gospel to all men (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:14">Romans 1:14</span>), hence his readiness to preach to them also (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:15">Romans 1:15</span>). The non-fulfilment of this desire and purpose occasioned the Epistle, the main thought of which immediately follows (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16-17">Romans 1:16-17</span>).
