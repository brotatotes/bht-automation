Romans 10:1.  Brethren. This term of affection, though not addressed to Jewish readers, was probably suggested by Paul’s feeling toward them; his severity was consistent with love; comp. Romans 9:1, etc., 1 Corinthians 9:20; Galatians 3:15.
	 The desire, lit., ‘good pleasure,’ not, ‘good will;’ the latter sense does not suit the context. ‘Desire’ is not exact, yet probably suggests the true sense: the salvation of Israel was the ideal of his heart (Godet). A Greek particle occurs   here, which implies that this verse presents the first member of a contrast; the corresponding word is not found in what follows, but the contrasted thought is evidently expressed in Romans 10:3.
	 Of my heart qualifies ‘desire’ only.
	 And my petition to God. ‘Prayer’ is not so exact as ‘petition;’ ‘to God’ is to be joined with ‘petition’ (as an incorrect reading indicates), and not with ‘is,’ which must be supplied in English (see below).

The mixture of these two ideas need occasion no difficulty when it is remembered that in the New Testament the combined purpose and purport of prayers are usually introduced by the word meaning ‘in order that.’
