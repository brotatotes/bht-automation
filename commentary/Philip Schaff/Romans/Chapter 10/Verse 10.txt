<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:10">Romans 10:10</span>. <strong> For with the heart</strong>, etc. This is an explanation of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:9">Romans 10:9</span>. ‘The idea of <em> salvation</em> is analyzed; it comprises two facts: being <em> justified </em> and being <em> saved</em> (in the full sense of the word). The first fact is specially connected with the act of <em> faith,</em> the second with that of <em> confession</em> ’ (Godet). Here belief comes first, in accordance with Christian experience.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Man believeth</strong>, lit, ‘it is believed,’ <strong> unto righteousness</strong>, <em> i.e.,</em> with this result, that righteousness is obtained; men are accounted righteous when they believe with the heart.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> And with the mouth confession is made</strong>, or, ‘man confesseth,’ lit., ‘it is confessed.’ The impersonal form has the force of a general statement. The E. V. fails to preserve the correspondence. We might render: ‘faith is exercised,’ to conform with ‘confession is made.’

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Unto salvation</strong>, with this result, namely, ‘salvation’; here including, as we hold, sanctification and glory. It is not necessary to limit this to the latter. The two parallel clauses are closely connected. True faith always leads to confession; confession is nothing without true faith. Public confession is a confirmation of our own faith; a bond of union with others; an outward pledge to consistent living; but above all an act of loyalty to Christ.</p>
