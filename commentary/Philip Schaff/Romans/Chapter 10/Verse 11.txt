<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:11">Romans 10:11</span>. <strong> For the Scripture saith</strong>. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span>, already cited in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:33">Romans 9:33</span>. After the extended proof that ‘Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one that believeth,’ the passage is introduced again to confirm that statement. Strictly speaking ‘for’ furnishes a proof of the former half of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:10">Romans 10:10</span>.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Whosoever</strong>, etc. The word answering to ‘whosoever,’ more literally, ‘every one’ is not found in the original passage (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:33">Romans 9:33</span>). But it is properly inserted here, because this idea of universality, which is implied in the original prophecy, has not only been established in the intervening discussion, but is the theme of the succeeding verses.</p>
