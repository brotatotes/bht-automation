If Christ is meant in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:12">Romans 10:12</span>, then this prophecy is applied ‘justly to <em> Christ</em>, who has appeared in the name of God, and continually rules as His Representative and Revealer, and Mediator, whose name was now the very specific object of the Christian calling on the Lord’ (Meyer). When, however, this author speaks of this ‘calling’ as not being ‘the worshipping absolutely,’ but rather ‘worship according to that relativity in the consciousness of the worshipper, which is conditioned by the relation of Christ to the Father,’ he is unsupported by the records of Christian experience. The heart of the believer, calling upon Jesus as Lord, makes a loyal surrender to Him, and in its joyous devotion to the Master, is not apt to make this distinction between absolute and relative worship, a distinction which is not in accordance with Biblical monotheism, and is verbal rather than real.</p>
