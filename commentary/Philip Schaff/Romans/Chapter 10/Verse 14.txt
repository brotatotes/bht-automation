Romans 10:14.  How they shall call, etc. In the case of the four verbs: ‘shall call,’ ‘shall believe,’ ‘shall hear,’ ‘shall preach,’ the subjunctive (deliberative) form is better supported. ‘They’ throughout is indefinite. ‘Can’ might be substituted for ‘shall,’ but is perhaps too strong. The Apostle argues from the cited prophecy (Romans 10:13) the  necessity of preachers sent forth in accordance with another prophecy (Romans 10:15), in order by thus enforcing the  universality of the gospel to show more plainly the responsibility of the Jews.
	 On  him, etc. Here and throughout the reference is to Christ
	 Have not believed; lit., ‘did not believe,’ indicating the beginning of faith; but English usage favors ‘have believed,’ and so in the next clause.
	 Of whom they have not heard. The reference is to hearing Christ through His preachers, or to hearing the Christ who is preached; since ‘of whom’ here cannot be grammatically explained as = about whom.
	 Without a preacher; apart from, independently of, one preaching,  i.e.,  proclaiming a message as a herald.
