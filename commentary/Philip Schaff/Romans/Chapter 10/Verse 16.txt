Romans 10:16. But, on the contrary, contrasting the preaching to all with the limited result, they, indefinitely used, though the application to the Jews is implied,  did not all hearken to the glad tidings. All who heard did not ‘hearken.’ There is a verbal correspondence in the Greek also. Faith was require those who did not believe were those who did not hearken.
	 For, introduces the proof that ‘not all’ hearkened.
	 Isaiah saith (chap. Isaiah 53:1). Paul believed that Isaiah was the author of the entire book. This state of things was foreseen and predicted; was not accidental, but was recognized in the Divine plan.
	 Who believed our report? The word ‘report’ is the same as ‘hearing’ in Romans 10:17; the variation in rendering obscures the argument. But it is difficult to find a word which will express the exact sense, namely, ‘that which is heard,’ almost equivalent to that which is preached. In older English the phrases ‘a good hearing,’ ‘a bad hearing,’ occur in the sense of good and bad news. It confuses the sense to understand it as what is heard of God (= the word of God), and the act of hearing is not meant; comp. Galatians 3:2. The citation is quite exact from the LXX., ‘Lord’ being inserted. The Messianic reference of the passage is an ample warrant for the application here made by the Apostle, to unbelief in the Christian preaching. The preaching of the gospel is a duty, whether men hearken or not; to believe the message is the necessary condition of really hearkening.
