Romans 10:2.  For I bear them witness. The reason for his desire and prayer is the fact to which he now bears his testimony.

Romans 9:1-5) was this religious zeal, which degenerated into blind fanaticism. But this, we infer from the passage, is better than indifferentism. Where there is some earnestness, there is something to hope for. In this respect the condition of many in Christian lands is less encouraging than that of the Jews in Paulâ€™s time.
