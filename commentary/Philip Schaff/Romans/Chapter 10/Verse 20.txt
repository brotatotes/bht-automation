<p><strong> I was found of them</strong>, etc. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:1">Isaiah 65:1</span> is here cited, with transposed clauses; otherwise quite closely after the LXX., which changes ‘I was sought’ (Hebrew) into ‘I was found,’ but quite in accordance with the original prophecy. That Paul understood the original prophecy as referring to the Gentiles must be maintained by all who admit his logical acuteness, and of course by those who accept his authority as an inspired Apostle. But many apply the words of Isaiah to the Jews, a view which is opposed by the rest of the verse (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:1">Isaiah 65:1</span>: ‘I said, behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name’), since the privilege of being called by the name of Jehovah was ever cherished by the ancient Jews and the word ‘nation’ is that used of Gentiles.</p>
