<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:21">Romans 10:21</span>. <strong> But with respect to Israel</strong>; not ‘to,’ nor yet, ‘against’ The contrast is between ‘Israel’ and the Gentiles referred to in the prophecy (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:20">Romans 10:20</span>).

<p><strong> He</strong>, <em> i.e.</em>, Isaiah, speaking for God, as in the previous verse, <strong> saith </strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:2">Isaiah 65:2</span>).

<p><strong> All</strong> <strong> day long I spread out</strong>, etc. The order of the LXX. is slightly changed in the citation. ‘Spread out,’ as one who invites to his embrace, or, even supplicates; this God is represented as doing without intermission, ‘the whole day.’

<p><strong> A disobedient</strong> <strong> and gainsaying people</strong>. So the LXX., but the Hebrew is simply ‘a rebellious people.’ Probably ‘disobedient’ presents the positive, and ‘gainsaying’ the negative side of the rebellious conduct; or rebellion is distinguished into refusing God’s commands and contradicting His words, disobedience and unbelief, acting and reacting upon each other continually. Habitual and continuous conduct is indicated by the form of the Greek. Thus the discussion of the responsibility of the Jews ends: God offered them the gospel, but they would not accept. The universality of the gospel implied the one way of faith; want of faith was the rejection of the universal gospel.
