<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:3">Romans 10:3</span>. <strong> For they</strong>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:3-4">Romans 10:3-4</span>, we have the proof from fact, that their religious zeal was ‘not according to knowledge.’ The thought, however, in contrast with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:1">Romans 10:1</span>, as already indicated.
