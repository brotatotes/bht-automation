Romans 10:6.  But the righteousness of faith. (‘Which is’ may be omitted; the form in the similar expression of Romans 10:5 is fuller.) As already indicated, ‘but’ introduces a contrast with the other ‘righteousness’ of doing (Romans 10:5). The personification is quite natural.
	 Saith thus; not, ‘speaketh,’ which suggests a contrast with ‘writeth.’
	 Say not in thy  heart (LXX., defectively; ‘saying;’ E. V: ‘that thou shouldst say.’) This phrase is = ‘think not,’ but usually suggests an evil thought
	 Who  shall ascend into heaven? ‘For us’ (LXX.) is omitted. This question is thus explained  by the Apostle in his own language, which he substitutes for the clause of design in the Old Testament passage. Similar clauses are substituted in Romans 10:7-8.
	 That is, to bring Christ down. ‘That is’ introduces the explanation, but the whole clause may mean either ( 1 .) ‘Whoever asks this’ question, says, in effect, who will bring Christ down? thus denying that He has come; or ( 2 .) ‘That is, in order to bring Christ down;’ substituting this  purpose for that expressed in Deuteronomy. The fatter sense agrees best with the view that Paul is interpreting the passage in Deuteronomy; the former with the other theories respecting his use of it. We interpret this clause as referring to the Incarnation, the coming down from heaven of the preexistent and promised Messiah (comp. Romans 10:9). Others refer it to the present exalted position of Christ
