Romans 10:9.  Because. The word may mean ‘that’ (as in E V.), indicating the purport of the word preached, but ‘because’ is preferable here. We have then a proof that ‘the word is nigh.’
	 If  thou shalt confess with thy month. This is placed first, to correspond with ‘in thy mouth’ (Romans 10:8); after the proof is completed the order is changed (Romans 10:10).
	 Jesus as Lord. There is little doubt that this is the correct explanation. This confession implies that He has become Incarnate (comp. Romans 10:6: ‘who shall ascend into heaven?’); for ‘Lord’ is the term applied to Jehovah in the LXX. ‘In this appellation is the sum of faith and salvation’ (Bengel).
