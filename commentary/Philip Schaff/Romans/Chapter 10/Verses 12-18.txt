Romans 10:12-18. We mark these verses as a separate paragraph. In the previous verses the method of faith is shown to have been Godâ€™s way of salvation in all ages; here it is declared to be His way for all people. It is  gratuitous, hence  universal. This way is  open to all (Romans 10:12-13) and is to b  e preached to all (Romans 10:14-18). This serves to emphasize the responsibility of the Jews for their own exclusion.
