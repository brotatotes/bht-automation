In the previous verses the method of faith is shown to have been Godâ€™s way of salvation in all ages; here it is declared to be His way for all people. It is <em> gratuitous</em>, hence <em> universal.</em> This way is <em> open</em> to all (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:12-13">Romans 10:12-13</span>) and is to b <em> e preached</em> to all (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:14-18">Romans 10:14-18</span>).
