<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:11">Romans 11:11</span>. <strong> I say then</strong>. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:1">Romans 11:1</span>. This introduces a possible, but incorrect, inference from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:7">Romans 11:7</span> (‘the rest were hardened’).

<p><strong> Did they</strong> <strong> stumble that they should fall</strong> <em> .</em> The form of the question points to a negative answer. The fact of stumbling is not, however, denied, since that has been affirmed in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:32-33">Romans 11:32-33</span>, nor yet the existence of a divine purpose (‘that’ = in order that) in connection with that fact, but as the con text shows, the Apostle denies that this purpose was the final fall ( <em> i.e.,</em> eternal destruction) of the nation. The first ‘they’ refers to the unbelieving mass of the nation, but the second evidently applies to them as representing the nation as a whole. As individuals they both stumbled and fell, but the design was not that the nation should fall. This view alone accords with the close of the chapter.

<p><strong> But by their trespass</strong>. The word ‘fall’ suggests a correspondence with the verb ‘should fall,’ whereas the reference is to ‘stumble.’ At the same time ‘trespass’ is not quite satisfactory.

<p><strong> Salvation</strong>, etc. This was the historical fact, and this fact had as its purpose: <strong> to provoke them to emulation</strong> (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:14">Romans 11:14</span>). The salvation of the Gentiles was therefore the immediate purpose, but there was a further design, namely, bringing about the final salvation of the Jews by stirring them up to emulation, or, zeal (‘jealousy’ has a bad sense not implied in the original). This twofold purpose forms the theme of the whole section.
