Romans 11:11.  I say then. Comp. Romans 11:1. This introduces a possible, but incorrect, inference from Romans 11:7 (‘the rest were hardened’).
	 Did they  stumble that they should fall  . The form of the question points to a negative answer. The fact of stumbling is not, however, denied, since that has been affirmed in chap. Romans 11:32-33, nor yet the existence of a divine purpose (‘that’ = in order that) in connection with that fact, but as the con text shows, the Apostle denies that this purpose was the final fall (  i.e., eternal destruction) of the nation. The first ‘they’ refers to the unbelieving mass of the nation, but the second evidently applies to them as representing the nation as a whole. As individuals they both stumbled and fell, but the design was not that the nation should fall. This view alone accords with the close of the chapter.
	 But by their trespass. The word ‘fall’ suggests a correspondence with the verb ‘should fall,’ whereas the reference is to ‘stumble.’ At the same time ‘trespass’ is not quite satisfactory.
	 Salvation, etc. This was the historical fact, and this fact had as its purpose:  to provoke them to emulation (as in Romans 11:14). The salvation of the Gentiles was therefore the immediate purpose, but there was a further design, namely, bringing about the final salvation of the Jews by stirring them up to emulation, or, zeal (‘jealousy’ has a bad sense not implied in the original). This twofold purpose forms the theme of the whole section.
