<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:13">Romans 11:13</span>. <strong> But I am sneaking to you Gentiles. </strong> ‘But’ is better supported than ‘for.’ The clause implies the preponderance of Gentile Christians in the congregation at Rome. We do not regard <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:13-14">Romans 11:13-14</span> as parenthetical, but as meeting a thought which might arise in the minds of the Gentile readers, namely, that his ministry, as the Apostle to the Gentiles, had no reference to the Jews. He shows that the blessed results to the Jews formed a part of the purpose of his labors (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:14">Romans 11:14</span>). Others think the implied objection relates to the prominence given to the Gentiles in God’s purpose respecting the Jews. But it is unlikely that the Gentiles would raise such an objection. Godet differs from both views, and finds in these verses a proof that the Apostle was laboring for the ultimate benefit of the Gentiles by seeking the conversion of the Jews, since the latter would result in ‘ life from the dead’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:15">Romans 11:15</span>), and thus bring blessing to the Gentiles. But the first view is to be preferred.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Inasmuch then</strong>, etc. ‘Then’ is well supported, and disconnects the clause from what precedes. We separate the clauses by a colon; others explain:’ I say to you Gentiles, inasmuch,’ etc. But ‘then’ opposes this view.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> I am,</strong> etc. ‘I’ is emphatic here.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> I glorify my</strong> <strong> ministry;</strong> <em> i.e.</em>, his ministry to the Gentiles. ‘Glorify’ is not = praise, or, magnify; the meaning is, by faithfully discharging the duties of this specific ministry he could do honor to it. The original suggests that there is another phase of the subject, which is stated (though not in exact correlation) in the next verse.
