Romans 11:18.  Boast not against,  or, ‘exult not over,’  the branches,   i.e., the people of Israel, not the branches which had been broken off. In Romans 11:19 the latter are specifically indicated. The warning has never been without an application to us Gentile Christians.

	 Thou bearest not the root,  etc. This is the fact which should prevent this disdainful attitude to the Jews. ‘The Gentiles had been brought into fellowship with the patriarchs, not the patriarchs with them. Salvation was from the Jews’ (Hodge).
