<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:21">Romans 11:21</span>. <strong> For if God spared not, </strong> as had been the case <strong> , the natural</strong> (lit, ‘according to nature’) <strong> branches</strong>, <em> i.e.</em>, the Jews who were not ingrafted but original branches of the patriarchal tree, <strong> he will also not spare thee.</strong> The more ancient authorities omit the word rendered ‘lest’ which made it necessary to supply ‘take heed,’ or, ‘it is to be feared’ (Meyer). Internal grounds may be urged in favor of the longer reading, but the manuscript authority is decisive against it. ‘Spare’ implies such an attitude in the person addressed as merits condemnation, so that nothing need be supplied.
