<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:22">Romans 11:22</span>. <strong> Behold therefore.</strong> The exhortation of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:20">Romans 11:20</span> (‘Be not high-minded, but fear’) is virtually repeated in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:22-24">Romans 11:22-24</span>, but now as an inference (‘therefore’) from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:21">Romans 11:21</span>.
	</p>
<p><strong> The goodness and severity of God.</strong> The former word is rendered ‘kindness’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:7">Ephesians 2:7</span> and elsewhere; the latter is the inflexible rigor of justice; both refer to the manifestations of God’s attributes, rather than to the attributes themselves.
	</p>
<p><strong> On them that fell;</strong> the unbelieving Jews, the figure of the branches being dropped for the moment.
	</p>
<p><strong> Severity</strong>. This word is in the nominative, according to the weightier authorities, and we may supply ‘there is.’
	</p>
<p><strong> But on thee</strong>; the preposition is the same as before; ‘toward’ might be used in both cases, but ‘on’ is somewhat closer to the original.
	</p>
<p><strong> God’s goodness</strong>; the nominative is the correct form here also, and the word ‘God’s’ is abundantly supported.
	</p>
<p><strong> If thou continue</strong>, etc. This is the common language of warning to Christians; the passage should not be used for or against the doctrines of perseverance, irresistible grace, etc. Moreover the warning is addressed to the Gentiles as <em> individualized, </em> not to an individual Gentile.
	</p>
<p><strong> Otherwise</strong>, or, ‘seeing that <em> otherwise? </em> the last word being implied, not expressed.
	</p>
<p><strong> Thou also shalt be out off.</strong> The word is a strong one, as if the branch were taken off with a sudden stroke of the axe. The warning is for every one of us Gentile Christians, and the wider application seems more appropriate than ever. Should judgment come on what is termed Christendom for its failure to abide in God’s goodness, the cutting off will be final; no promise remains as in the case of the Jewish nation; see next verse.
