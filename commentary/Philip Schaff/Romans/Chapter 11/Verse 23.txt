Romans 11:23.  And they also,  i.e.,  the unbelieving Jews, who are like wild olive branches. The verse should not be joined too closely with Romans 11:22, since it presents a further thought.
	 Continue; the same word as in Romans 11:22.
	 Their unbelief; as in Romans 11:20.
	 For God is able, etc. When unbelief ceases, His power will be manifested. It is implied that even when broken off it is easy for God  to graft them in again, as it was to graft in the wild olive branches. The next verse shows that such a result is  more to be expected,  not that it is  easier  for God to do this.
