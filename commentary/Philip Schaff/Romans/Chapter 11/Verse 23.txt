<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:23">Romans 11:23</span>. <strong> And they also</strong>, <em> i.e., </em> the unbelieving Jews, who are like wild olive branches. The verse should not be joined too closely with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:22">Romans 11:22</span>, since it presents a further thought.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> For God is able</strong>, etc. When unbelief ceases, His power will be manifested. It is implied that even when broken off it is easy for God <strong> to graft them in again</strong>, as it was to graft in the wild olive branches. The next verse shows that such a result is <em> more to be expected, </em> not that it is <em> easier </em> for God to do this.
