<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> When I shall take away their sins. </strong> Meyer rightly explains the verse thus: ‘And when I shall have forgiven their sins, this (this remission of sins conferred by me) will be my covenant to them ( <em> i.e.</em>, they will therein have from me the execution of my covenant).’ This reference to the taking away of sin was more appropriate to the Apostle’s purpose than the promise of the Spirit which follows in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:21">Isaiah 59:21</span>.
