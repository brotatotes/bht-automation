<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:3">Romans 11:3</span>. <strong> Lord, they have killed</strong>, etc. This verse is freely cited from the LXX.; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:10">1 Kings 19:10</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:14">Romans 11:14</span> is a repetition of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:10">Romans 11:10</span>). The two clauses are transposed.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> They have digged down</strong>. ‘And’ is poorly supported.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Thine altars</strong>. The p lural points to the altars as the high places in the kingdom of Israel where Elijah lived. Although it was originally forbidden to erect such altars, they became the only places in Israel where Jehovah was publicly worshipped. Hence in the time of Elijah neglect of these was really neglect of worship.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> I am left alone</strong>, or, ‘the only one.’ The latter rendering corresponds better with the LXX., but is somewhat stronger than Paul’s citation. The language of Elijah meant that he was the only prophet left; while the transposition of the clauses suggests here the further notion: I am the only true worshipper of Jehovah. It is not necessary to suppose that the Apostle has departed from the original sense.
