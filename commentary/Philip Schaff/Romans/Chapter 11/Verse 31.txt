<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Have these </strong> (Jews) <strong> now, </strong> since the gospel of Christ was preached, <strong> been disobedient</strong>; lit., ‘were disobedient,’ as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:30">Romans 11:30</span>, but ‘now’ compels us to render ‘have been disobedient.’
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> That, </strong> in order that, <strong> by the mercy shown to you </strong> (lit. ‘your mercy;’ in emphatic position in the original) <strong> they also may now obtain mercy. </strong> The leading thought of the section (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:11">Romans 11:11</span>) is here repeated, in the final summing up. This view is so natural and accords so entirely with the parallelism as to forbid the explanations of the Vulgate, Luther, and others; ‘they have not believed in the mercy shown to you,’ or, ‘were disobedient through the mercy shown to you.’
