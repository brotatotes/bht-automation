Romans 11:34.  For who,  etc. The Apostle here uses, almost exactly the language of Isaiah 40:13; but, by adding ‘for,’ he makes it the confirmation of what precedes. The first question may be referred to God’s ‘knowledge’ and ‘His ways,’ since no one  hath known the mind of the Lord; the second to His ‘wisdom,’ and ‘judgments,’ since in forming His decision no one  hath been His counsellor.
