<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:34">Romans 11:34</span>. <strong> For who, </strong> etc. The Apostle here uses, almost exactly the language of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:13">Isaiah 40:13</span>; but, by adding ‘for,’ he makes it the confirmation of what precedes. The first question may be referred to God’s ‘knowledge’ and ‘His ways,’ since no one <strong> hath known the mind of the Lord</strong>; the second to His ‘wisdom,’ and ‘judgments,’ since in forming His decision no one <strong> hath been His counsellor.
