Romans 11:35.  Or who hath first given,  etc. This is from Job 41:11, but follows the Hebrew, not the mistranslation of the LXX. This question refers to the depth of Godâ€™s riches. No gift can recompense God; nothing can be purchased of Him. How appropriate to the entire discussion. The gospel is all of grace; the plan respecting Jews and Gentiles is all of grace. Nothing of merit or recompense; all freely bestowed out of the ocean depths of riches in God Himself.
