<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:35">Romans 11:35</span>. <strong> Or who hath first given, </strong> etc. This is from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="job+41:11">Job 41:11</span>, but follows the Hebrew, not the mistranslation of the LXX. This question refers to the depth of Godâ€™s riches. No gift can recompense God; nothing can be purchased of Him. How appropriate to the entire discussion. The gospel is all of grace; the plan respecting Jews and Gentiles is all of grace. Nothing of merit or recompense; all freely bestowed out of the ocean depths of riches in God Himself.
