Romans 11:5.  Even so then, or, ‘thus therefore;’ in accordance with this historical fact which indicates  (‘ therefore’) a permanent principle,  in this  present time also, as well as in the similar ancient times,  there is  (more exactly  , ‘has become,’ and still exists)  a remnant, a small number out of the mass; and this ‘remnant’ has become and remains such,  according to the election of grace. This phrase is to be joined, not with the noun, but with the verb (as above indicated). Here the reference is not national, but individual, as in chap. 9 . This view is further sustained by Romans 11:6, and by the obvious opposition to Jewish pride of works: the election has its source in God’s grace, not in man’s merit.
