<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:5">Romans 11:5</span>. <strong> Even so then</strong>, or, ‘thus therefore;’ in accordance with this historical fact which indicates <em> (‘</em> therefore’) a permanent principle, <strong> in this</strong> <strong> present time also</strong>, as well as in the similar ancient times, <strong> there is </strong> (more exactly <em> ,</em> ‘has become,’ and still exists) <strong> a remnant</strong>, a small number out of the mass; and this ‘remnant’ has become and remains such, <strong> according to the election of grace</strong>. This phrase is to be joined, not with the noun, but with the verb (as above indicated). Here the reference is not national, but individual, as in chap. 9 . This view is further sustained by <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:6">Romans 11:6</span>, and by the obvious opposition to Jewish pride of works: the election has its source in God’s grace, not in man’s merit.
