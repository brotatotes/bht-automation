<p>1. <em> The Rejection of Israel is not Total.
	</em></p>
<p>This section opens with the question (‘Did God cast off His people?’), which the whole chapter answers in the negative, and which Paul discusses with a feeling both patriotic and religious (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:1">Romans 11:1</span>). The historical fact in the days of Elijah (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:2-4">Romans 11:2-4</span>) shows that, now as then, when all seem to have rejected Jehovah, He still has a remnant according to the election of grace (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:5">Romans 11:5</span>), not of works (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:6">Romans 11:6</span>). At the same time the many were rejected (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:7">Romans 11:7</span>), in accordance with the predictions of Isaiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:8">Romans 11:8</span>) and David (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:9-10">Romans 11:9-10</span>).
