1.  The Rejection of Israel is not Total.
	This section opens with the question (‘Did God cast off His people?’), which the whole chapter answers in the negative, and which Paul discusses with a feeling both patriotic and religious (Romans 11:1). The historical fact in the days of Elijah (Romans 11:2-4) shows that, now as then, when all seem to have rejected Jehovah, He still has a remnant according to the election of grace (Romans 11:5), not of works (Romans 11:6). At the same time the many were rejected (Romans 11:7), in accordance with the predictions of Isaiah (Romans 11:8) and David (Romans 11:9-10).
