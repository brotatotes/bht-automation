2.  The Rejection of Israel is not Final.
	In this section is presented the prospective solution of the great historical problem, discussed in this part of the Epistle. Here Paul becomes a prophet; revealing that the rejection of Israel is not final, since the chosen people will be restored.
	The section naturally falls into four paragraphs: (1.) The present hardening of so many of the Jews will not result in the final rejection of the nation, but will accomplish two ends: first, the conversion of the Gentiles, and secondly their own restoration, to be ‘life from the dead’; Romans 11:11-15. (2.) In view of this the Gentiles should not exalt themselves over the Jews, since the restoration of the latter to spiritual blessings is an event both desirable and probable; Romans 11:16-24. (3.) The Apostle makes known, by revelation, the final conversion of Israel, showing that this is in accordance with prophecy, and with the general principles which underlie God’s dealings with men; Romans 11:25-32. (4.) The thought of Romans 11:32 leads to a doxology, which forms the climax of the Epistle; Romans 11:33-36. This doxology forms an appropriate conclusion, first to this section, then to the discussion of chaps. 9-11, and, finally, to the entire doctrinal part of the Epistle.
