 PRACTICAL PART.
	MAN’S GRATITUDE FOR FREE SALVATION.
	The theme of this part of the Epistle is given in chap. Romans 12:1: The believer saved by Christ through faith is to present himself a thank-offering to God; all Christian duty is praise for deliverance. For convenience we may divide this portion as follows: I. GENERAL EXHORTATIONS; based directly upon the theme; chaps, 12, 13 (Strictly speaking, chap. Romans 13:1-7 forms a special discussion, see the Romans Book Comments and  in loco.)
	II. SPECIAL DISCUSSION   regarding the scruples of certain weak brethren, who abstain from eating meat, etc.: Romans 14:1 to Romans 15:13.
	III. CONCLUDING PORTION; personal explanations, greetings to and from various persons, with a closing doxology: chaps, Romans 15:14 to Romans 16:27.
	 1. GENERAL EXHORTATIONS.
	In these two chapters the Apostle gives exhortations respecting Christian duties, based upon the controlling obligation to present ourselves a living thank-offering to God. Godet distinguishes these precepts as pertaining respectively to the  religious (chap. 12) and to the  civil sphere (chap. 13). We prefer to divide into sections as follows: (1.) Practical theme: duties according to special gifts; chap. Romans 12:1-8. (2.) Duties for all Christians in personal relations, springing from brotherly love and extending to returning good for evil; chap. Romans 12:8-21. (3.) The Christian’s duty to earthly rulers; chap. Romans 13:1-7. (4.) General exhortation to love, and to a Christian walk; chap. Romans 13:8-14. The thoughts are linked to each other rather than arranged by a formal method. Other divisions readily suggest themselves, but this will prove as convenient as any other.
