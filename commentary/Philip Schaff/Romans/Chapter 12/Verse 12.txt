Romans 12:12.  In hope, rejoicing.  The hope,  i.e., the thing hoped for, is the ground rather than the object of the joy.
	 In  tribulation, patient,   i.e.,  steadfast as usually. This clause follows, probably because the Christianâ€™s joyous hope produces endurance in affliction.
	 In prayer, persevering  (see marginal references). Neither joy nor endurance is abiding without such constant prayer.
