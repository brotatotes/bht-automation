<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:12">Romans 12:12</span>. <strong> In hope, rejoicing. </strong> The hope, <em> i.e.</em>, the thing hoped for, is the ground rather than the object of the joy.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> In</strong> <strong> tribulation, patient, </strong> <em> i.e., </em> steadfast as usually. This clause follows, probably because the Christianâ€™s joyous hope produces endurance in affliction.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> In prayer, persevering </strong> (see marginal references). Neither joy nor endurance is abiding without such constant prayer.
