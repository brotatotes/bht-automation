Romans 12:15.  Rejoice with them,  etc. The infinitive occurs in the original, and we may paraphrase: ‘  it is necessary,  to rejoice,’ etc. ‘ Romans 12:14 defines the proper conduct in relation to personal  antipathy; Romans 12:15, the proper conduct in relation to personal  sympathy’  (Lange). The verse is not interjected, nor is the exhortation weaker. Sympathy is not less difficult than forgiveness. The latter is less active than the former, and may exist when the range of Christian feeling is too limited for wide and quick sympathy. But forgetfulness of self is the basis of both virtues.
