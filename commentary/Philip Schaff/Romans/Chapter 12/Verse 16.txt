Romans 12:16.  Be of the same mind,  etc. The participial form recurs, but the force is still imperative. This precept refers to concord in feeling, though not to the exclusion of corresponding thought and endeavor.
	 Mind not high things.  The verb is the same as in the previous clause (lit, ‘minding the same; minding not the high things’). This may be taken as a general warning against ambition, or ‘high things’ may refer to the distinctions which arise among Christians, whether social or official, and which are so naturally sought after. The latter view accords with the common rendering of the next clause.
	 But condescend to  (be carried along by)  men of low estate,  or ‘lowly things.’ It is difficult to decide whether the last phrase is masculine or neuter, the same form being used for both genders. Meyer accepts the latter and explains: ‘yielding to that which is humble, to the claims and tasks which are presented to you by the humbler relations of life;’ he cites Paul’s example, as tentmaker and sufferer. The neuter occurs in the previous clause, but the adjective is masculine in all other instances in the New Testament, and the next clause favors the reference to persons.
	 Be not wise in your own conceits. This is closely connected with the other precepts, for such self-sufficiency in judgment usually attends ambition, and serves to foster the aristocratic feeling, which, as Godet intimates, the Apostle opposes throughout this verse. Nothing destroys Christian fellowship more effectually than this conceit of wisdom.
