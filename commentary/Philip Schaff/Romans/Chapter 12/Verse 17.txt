<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:17">Romans 12:17</span>. <strong> Recompense to no man evil for evil. </strong> The proper treatment of those opposed to us was spoken of in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:14">Romans 12:14</span>, and from this point is the sole topic of the section. ‘No man’ who injures us, whether Christian brother or one without, so in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:14">Romans 12:14</span>. The Apostle ‘knew too well by experience that in the bosom of the Church itself one could encounter malevolence, injustice, jealousy, hate’ (Godet). The principle is plain, but the temptation to disobey is often very strong.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Have a care for things honorable in the sight of all men. </strong> The E. V. is misleading, conveying to the ordinary reader the thought that we are bidden to provide for ourselves and our families in an honest way. ‘In the sight of all men’ is to be joined with the verb, not with honorable. ‘Man’s estimate of what is ‘honorable’ is not the standard; but all should see that our effort is for what is ‘honorable.’ Hodge finds here the motive for the preceding exhortation: ‘let a regard for the honor of religion and your own character prevent the returning of evil for evil,’ but the connection is not obvious. The care for things honorable might serve to dispossess the desire for retaliation.
