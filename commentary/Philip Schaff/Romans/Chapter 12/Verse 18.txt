Romans 12:18.  If it be possible, at much  at dependeth on you; not, ‘if you  can,’  but if it be possible, if others allow you to do so,  be at peace with all men.   That this is sometimes impossible, the Apostle’s life shows; but our responsibility extends as far as our ability to keep the peace.
