<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:18">Romans 12:18</span>. <strong> If it be possible, at much</strong> <strong> at dependeth on you</strong>; not, ‘if you <em> can,’ </em> but if it be possible, if others allow you to do so, <strong> be at peace with all men</strong>. <strong> </strong> That this is sometimes impossible, the Apostle’s life shows; but our responsibility extends as far as our ability to keep the peace.
