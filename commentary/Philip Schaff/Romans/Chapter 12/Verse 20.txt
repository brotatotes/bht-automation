<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:20">Romans 12:20</span>. <strong> But, </strong> <em> i.e., </em> ‘on the contrary,’ ‘nay rather’ (Alford). The authorities present several variations; but the oldest manuscripts and more recent editors accept ‘but.’

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> If thine enemy</strong>, etc. The rest of the verse corresponds exactly with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="pr+25:21">Proverbs 25:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="pr+25:23">Proverbs 25:23</span> (LXX.) and is adopted by the Apostle without a formula of citation. The only difficulty is in the last clause; <strong> thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. </strong> Explanations: (1.) Thou wilt thus leave him to severer divine punishment. This is opposed by the next verse, and contrary to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="pr+24:17">Proverbs 24:17</span>. (2.) Thou wilt prepare for him the glowing shame of penitence; so Augustine, Meyer, Godet, and many others. This is not open to any serious objection, if real penitence be understood. Simply to make him ashamed is not an exalted motive. (3.) Thou wilt by this kindness most readily subdue him, thus taking the most effectual vengeance; so Alford, Hodge, and others. This really includes (2), and is favored by the next verse. Tyndale’s gloss is: ‘This means that thou shalt kindle him and make him to love.’ Besides these, a number of fanciful interpretations have been suggested.
