<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> Through the grace that was given to me. </strong> He thus refers to his apostleship (see marginal references); humbly making an appeal for the humility he enjoins.

<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> To every man that is among you</strong>; applying the precept to each and all without exception.

<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> Not to think of himself, </strong> etc. There is a play upon words in the original which it is difficult to reproduce in English: Alford renders ‘not to be highminded, above that which he ought to be minded, but to be so minded as to be sober-minded.’
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> But to think so as to think soberly, </strong> or, ‘so as to be sober-minded.’ Some would render, ‘but to be so disposed as to be sober minded;’ but the reference to thought of one’s self is preferable. The aim of one’s self-knowledge should be wise discretion. Practically self-esteem leads to indiscretion.

It is in fact the subjective designation of the grace which is given us; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:6">Romans 12:6</span> ’ (Alford). This clause prepares the way for the specifications which follow (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:6-8">Romans 12:6-8</span>) which show that the ‘measure of faith’ is different in degree in different cases, and adapted to peculiarities of character. Since this standard is <em> ‘</em> as God hath dealt to each one,’ there is no room for thinking too highly of ourselves.
