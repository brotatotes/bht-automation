Romans 12:3.  For I say,  ‘The special  requirement  which he is now to make serves in fact by way of  confirmation  to the general exhortation of Romans 12:2 ’ (Meyer).
	 Through the grace that was given to me.  He thus refers to his apostleship (see marginal references); humbly making an appeal for the humility he enjoins.
	 To every man that is among you; applying the precept to each and all without exception.
	 Not to think of himself,  etc. There is a play upon words in the original which it is difficult to reproduce in English: Alford renders ‘not to be highminded, above that which he ought to be minded, but to be so minded as to be sober-minded.’
	 But to think so as to think soberly,  or, ‘so as to be sober-minded.’ Some would render, ‘but to be so disposed as to be sober minded;’ but the reference to thought of one’s self is preferable. The aim of one’s self-knowledge should be wise discretion. Practically self-esteem leads to indiscretion.
	 According as  God,  etc. This clause qualifies the last one: ‘to think so as,’ etc.
	 To each one the measure of faith.  The article is wanting before ‘measure,’ but as it refers to the particular measure in each case, we must supply it, or strengthen it into ‘his measure.’ ‘Faith’ is here subjective, as usual; and the entire phrase points to the individual Christian’s ‘receptivity of grace of the Spirit, itself no inherent congruity, but the gift and apportionment of God. It is in fact the subjective designation of the grace which is given us; Romans 12:6 ’ (Alford). This clause prepares the way for the specifications which follow (Romans 12:6-8) which show that the ‘measure of faith’ is different in degree in different cases, and adapted to peculiarities of character. Since this standard is  ‘ as God hath dealt to each one,’ there is no room for thinking too highly of ourselves.
