Romans 12:5.  So we, the many,  not, ‘  being  many,’ but ‘the many,’ like the many members of the body,  are one body in Christ  (see marginal references).
	 And severally,  etc. The phrase is very unusual; it is literally: ‘and what (is true) as to individuals, (they are) members of one another.’ Christ is the Head, and fellowship with Him makes us one body, and in consequence the individual relation is that of fellow-member with every other.
