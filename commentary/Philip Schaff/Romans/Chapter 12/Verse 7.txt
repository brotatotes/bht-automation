Romans 12:7.  Or ministry.  The second gift. Some refer this to all the permanent offices of a single church, taking the five following terms as included under it. The change of construction in the next clause slightly favors this view, but it cannot be positively established. The usual view refers it to the  diaconate  (which the Greek term may mean), namely, the gift of oversight of the external affairs of the church.
	 Let us wait on our ministry, lit., ‘in the ministry,’ just spoken of. We might supply, ‘let us be,’ since the exhortation means let us render service in our appointed sphere, therein ‘be instant’ (comp. 1 Timothy 4:15). It has happened ever since those who had a gift, and a corresponding office, for the external affairs of the church, have not been content to limit their efforts to their proper sphere.
	 Or he that teacheth,  on teaching,  lit., ‘the teaching,’ his sphere. This refers to the gift of teaching by ordinary methods and need not be limited to any special office. Paul was himself a teacher. This gift is a permanent one, and cannot be too highly prized; the danger now as then, is the possessor’s mistaking his gift, or stepping outside of it to exercise functions for which he is not adapted.
