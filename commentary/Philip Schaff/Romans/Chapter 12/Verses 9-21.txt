2.  Exhortation for all Christians,  in their Personal Relations,  from Love of the Brethren to returning Good for Evil.
	 All the precepts of this section are based upon Christian love (Romans 12:9). After exhorting that this love be without hypocrisy, and noting the moral attitude it produces, the Apostle gives special injunctions respecting its various active manifestations. He begins with tenderness toward the brethren (Romans 12:10), and names many ways in which Christian love outwardly manifests itself (Romans 12:11-13; Romans 12:15-16), culminating in its treatment of those who are opposed to us and have injured us (Romans 12:14; Romans 12:17-21).
