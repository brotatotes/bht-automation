Romans 13:10.  Love worketh no ill to his neighbor,  lit, ‘the neighbor.’ Alford: ‘All the commandments of the law above cited are  negative:  the formal fulfilment of them is therefore attained, by  working no ill  to one’s neighbor. What greater things love works he does not now say.’ Paul’s further comments on this thought may be found in 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 (Meyer).  Love therefore is the fulfilment of the law.  A repetition of the proposition of Romans 13:8 after its truth has been demonstrated (Romans 13:9-10). ‘Fulfilment’ is a more accurate rendering than ‘fulfilling’ (E. V.).
