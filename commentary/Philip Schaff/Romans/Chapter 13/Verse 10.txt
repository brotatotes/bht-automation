<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:10">Romans 13:10</span>. <strong> Love worketh no ill to his neighbor, </strong> lit, ‘the neighbor.’ Alford: ‘All the commandments of the law above cited are <em> negative: </em> the formal fulfilment of them is therefore attained, by <em> working no ill </em> to one’s neighbor. What greater things love works he does not now say.’ Paul’s further comments on this thought may be found in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:4-7">1 Corinthians 13:4-7</span> (Meyer). </p>
<p><strong> Love therefore is the fulfilment of the law. </strong> A repetition of the proposition of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:8">Romans 13:8</span> after its truth has been demonstrated (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:9-10">Romans 13:9-10</span>). ‘Fulfilment’ is a more accurate rendering than ‘fulfilling’ (E. V.).
