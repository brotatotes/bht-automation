<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:12">Romans 13:12</span>. <strong> The night is far spent, </strong> etc. The figure here must be interpreted in accordance with the view taken of ‘salvation <em> ’ </em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:11">Romans 13:11</span>). ‘The night’ is primarily the period up to the Advent, the approach of which is indicated: <strong> the day is at hand. </strong> Of course there are other applications; ‘the day will break a hundred times, in ever greater potencies, between the first and the second coming of Christ’ (Lange). But it is fanciful to refer ‘the night’ to the spiritual condition of heathen Rome, and ‘the day’ to Christian Rome.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Let us put on the armor of light. </strong> Spiritual light is the possession of the believer; he is exhorted to put on the armor which properly be longs thereto. His clothing is not for luxury, or show, but for a conflict (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13">Ephesians 6:13</span>). The ‘armor’ represents principles, modes of action, rather than the resulting good deeds.
