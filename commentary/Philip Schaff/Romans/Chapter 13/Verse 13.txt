<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:13">Romans 13:13</span>. <strong> Let us walk seemly, as in the day. </strong> Both ‘honestly’ (E. V.) and ‘decently’ (E. V. margin) are too limited, the reference being to decorum, such as befits the day when conduct is open to observation.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Not in rioting and drunkenness. </strong> The former refers to nocturnal revels, and was probably suggested by the figures of ‘night’ and ‘day;’ the latter means drunken carousals; both are plural in the original.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Not in chambering and wantonness. </strong> Various forms of secret vice are here indicated by the plural. These sins are closely connected with the preceding, often caused by them. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:19">Galatians 5:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:19">Ephesians 4:19</span> and elsewhere, the word rendered ‘wanton ness’ occurs, but is translated ‘lasciviousness.’ It points to an abandoned sensuality.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Not in strife and</strong> <strong> jealousy. </strong> These follow in the train of sensuality, as Roman life was then testifying most sadly. (‘Envying’ is inexact.) The entire family of vices is well-known, and the relationship obvious.
