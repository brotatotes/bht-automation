Romans 13:13.  Let us walk seemly, as in the day.  Both ‘honestly’ (E. V.) and ‘decently’ (E. V. margin) are too limited, the reference being to decorum, such as befits the day when conduct is open to observation.
	 Not in rioting and drunkenness.  The former refers to nocturnal revels, and was probably suggested by the figures of ‘night’ and ‘day;’ the latter means drunken carousals; both are plural in the original.
	 Not in chambering and wantonness.  Various forms of secret vice are here indicated by the plural. These sins are closely connected with the preceding, often caused by them. In Galatians 5:19; Ephesians 4:19 and elsewhere, the word rendered ‘wanton ness’ occurs, but is translated ‘lasciviousness.’ It points to an abandoned sensuality.
	 Not in strife and  jealousy.  These follow in the train of sensuality, as Roman life was then testifying most sadly. (‘Envying’ is inexact.) The entire family of vices is well-known, and the relationship obvious.
