Romans 13:14.  But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ.  Comp. marginal references. In Galatians 3:27 the putting on of Christ is represented as a finished fact (in principle), but here the exhortation is to a continuous duty. In both cases vital fellowship is meant, but each step in the growing conformity to Christ is a new putting on of Him, so that we present Him, not ourselves, in our conduct.
	 And make not provision for the flesh,  etc. There are two views of this passage. (1.) Flesh is taken in the strictly ethical sense; the meaning will then be: make no provision whatever for the flesh (the depraved nature), so as to fulfil its lusts, and also because such provision would fulfil them. In favor of this may be urged, the emphatic position of ‘flesh’ in the original; its usual sense in this Epistle, and the contrast with putting on Christ Jesus. (2.) Flesh is understood in its physiological sense, the material of the body, which is the source and seat of sensual desires. The sense then is, make such provision for the flesh, as shall not fulfil its lusts. The position of the word ‘not’ in the original favors this view, but it is otherwise objectionable.
