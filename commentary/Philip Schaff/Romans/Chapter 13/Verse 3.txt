<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:3">Romans 13:3</span>. <strong> For rulers</strong> (lit, ‘the rulers,’ as a class), etc. Some connect this with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:1">Romans 13:1</span>, as an additional reason for obedience, namely, the salutary design of government; others find here the ground for the last clause of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:2">Romans 13:2</span>. The former accords better with the fuller statements of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:3-4">Romans 13:3-4</span>.

<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> Not a terror to the good work,</strong> etc. ‘The good work’ and ‘the evil’ are personified. ‘Beyond the <em> work, </em> and to the <em> intention, </em> the prerogative of the magistrate does not extend’ (Meyer). If this verse gives a reason for the last clause of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:2">Romans 13:2</span>, then ‘good work’ and ‘evil’ must be limited to obedience and resistance; which seems objectionable.

<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> Dost thou then wish,</strong> etc. The clause may be taken as hypothetical: ‘Thou dost not wish,’ etc.

<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> Thou shalt have praise from the same. </strong> In thus presenting an ideal of civil government, the Apostle gives the reason for obedience to rightful authority, and establishes a principle of general validity. But the ideal itself suggests that when rulers become a terror to the good work, another maxim can have place, that of the Apostles (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:29">Acts 5:29</span>): ‘We must obey God rather than man.’ Nero had not yet shown his true character, when this Epistle was written. Even he persecuted the Christians as alleged evil-doers.
