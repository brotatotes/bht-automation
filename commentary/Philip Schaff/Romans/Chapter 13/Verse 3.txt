Romans 13:3.  For rulers (lit, ‘the rulers,’ as a class), etc. Some connect this with Romans 13:1, as an additional reason for obedience, namely, the salutary design of government; others find here the ground for the last clause of Romans 13:2. The former accords better with the fuller statements of Romans 13:3-4.
	 Not a terror to the good work, etc. ‘The good work’ and ‘the evil’ are personified. ‘Beyond the  work,  and to the  intention,  the prerogative of the magistrate does not extend’ (Meyer). If this verse gives a reason for the last clause of Romans 13:2, then ‘good work’ and ‘evil’ must be limited to obedience and resistance; which seems objectionable.
	 Dost thou then wish, etc. The clause may be taken as hypothetical: ‘Thou dost not wish,’ etc.
	 Thou shalt have praise from the same.  In thus presenting an ideal of civil government, the Apostle gives the reason for obedience to rightful authority, and establishes a principle of general validity. But the ideal itself suggests that when rulers become a terror to the good work, another maxim can have place, that of the Apostles (Acts 5:29): ‘We must obey God rather than man.’ Nero had not yet shown his true character, when this Epistle was written. Even he persecuted the Christians as alleged evil-doers.
