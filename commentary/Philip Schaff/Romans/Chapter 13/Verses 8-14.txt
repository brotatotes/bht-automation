<p>4. <em> General Exhortation to Love</em>, <em> and to a Christian Walk.
	</em></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> The more general exhortation of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:8">Romans 13:8</span> seems to have been suggested by the thought of obligation which underlies <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:7">Romans 13:7</span>: fulfil all obligations; but the universal one, which can never be fully discharged, is that of love to one another. The ground of this obligation, as the fulfilment of the law, is then discussed (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:9-10">Romans 13:9-10</span>). A motive is introduced, drawn from the approaching day of the Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:11-12">Romans 13:11-12</span> <em> a),</em> which is made the basis of further exhortations to a corresponding Christian wall, (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:12-14">Romans 13:12-14</span>).
