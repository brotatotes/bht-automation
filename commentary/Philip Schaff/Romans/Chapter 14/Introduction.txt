	</em></p>
<p>II. SPECIAL DISCUSSION <strong> </strong> regarding the scruples of certain weak brethren, who abstain from eating meat, etc.: <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:1">Romans 14:1</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:13">Romans 15:13</span>.
