<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:1">Romans 14:1</span>. <strong> Him that is weak in the faith. </strong> (See note above.) The phrase might be rendered ‘weak in faith,’ or even, ‘in his faith,’ since faith in Christ is meant, not Christian doctrine, or, moral conviction, or, knowledge. The latter ideas are implied; for in the cases referred to the faith did not have its practical result in moral discernment and conviction in regard to what properly belonged to a life of faith.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Receive ye</strong>; do not reject or discourage him, but count him one of your number, in fraternal fellowship. This exhortation suggests that the weak brethren were in a <strong> </strong> small minority.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> But not</strong> <strong> to doubtful disputations, </strong> lit., ‘unto judgings of thoughts.’ This clause is addressed to the stronger brethren, who formed the great majority of the church. While they receive the weak <strong> </strong> brother, it should not be in such a way as to produce this result, that his thoughts (in this case the scruples named in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:2">Romans 14:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:5">Romans 14:5</span>. etc.) are criticised and judged. To refer it to both parties is opposed by the form of the sentence. The word ‘thoughts’ here refers to doubts, but does not itself mean this. Godet explains: debates consisting in vain reasonings. But the word ‘judgings’ means decisions, or, discriminations of judgment, while ‘thoughts,’ though usually having a had sense in the New Testament, never means vain reasonings. Lange’s view: ‘Not to the judicial decision of motives,’ though a proper inference, is lexically indefensible.
