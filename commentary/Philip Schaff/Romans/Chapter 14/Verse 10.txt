Romans 14:10.  But why dost thou judge thy brother?  ‘Thou’ is emphatic, ‘thou’ belonging to Christ the Lord. ‘Thy brother’ marks an advance in thought from Romans 14:3-4. This is addressed to the weak brother.
	 Or thou also, why dost thou set at nought thy brother?  Addressed to the stronger brother, who ‘also,’ by setting at nought his brother, overlooks the fact that both belong to Christ
	 For,  as a reason for both the preceding questions,  we shall all  stand before the judgment seat of God. The oldest manuscripts read ‘God,’ which is accepted by nearly all modern critical editors. ‘Christ’ was   probably substituted, to correspond with Romans 14:9, or, from 2 Corinthians 5:10. The question of the divinity of Christ is not affected by the variation. ‘The judging of one’s brother therefore, first encroaches upon Christ’s office as   ruler, and, second, anticipates the judgment bar of God’ (Lange).
