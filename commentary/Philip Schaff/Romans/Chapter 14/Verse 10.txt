<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:10">Romans 14:10</span>. <strong> But why dost thou judge thy brother? </strong> ‘Thou’ is emphatic, ‘thou’ belonging to Christ the Lord. ‘Thy brother’ marks an advance in thought from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:3-4">Romans 14:3-4</span>. This is addressed to the weak brother.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Or thou also, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? </strong> Addressed to the stronger brother, who ‘also,’ by setting at nought his brother, overlooks the fact that both belong to Christ
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> For, </strong> as a reason for both the preceding questions, <strong> we shall all</strong> <strong> stand before the judgment seat of God.</strong> The oldest manuscripts read ‘God,’ which is accepted by nearly all modern critical editors. ‘Christ’ was <strong> </strong> probably substituted, to correspond with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:9">Romans 14:9</span>, or, from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:10">2 Corinthians 5:10</span>. The question of the divinity of Christ is not affected by the variation. ‘The judging of one’s brother therefore, first encroaches upon Christ’s office as <strong> </strong> ruler, and, second, anticipates the judgment bar of God’ (Lange).
