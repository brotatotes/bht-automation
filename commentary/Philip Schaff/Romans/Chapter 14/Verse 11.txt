<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:11">Romans 14:11</span>. <strong> For it is written </strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:23">Isaiah 45:23</span>). The citation is freely made, the variations are, <strong> As I live </strong> for ‘I have sworn by myself’ and <strong> shall give praise to God</strong> for ‘shall swear’ (LXX. ‘unto God’). The word <strong> </strong> ‘give praise’ usually means ‘confess,’ but followed by a dative, as here, has the signification, ‘render homage,’ ‘give praise.’ The general thought thus expressed by the Apostle lay at the basis of the more special one of the Old Testament passage. The whole, in any case, is regarded as a prophecy of the final judgment, furnishing a proof of the last clause of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:10">Romans 14:10</span>.
