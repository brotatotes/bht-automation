Romans 14:12.  So then each one of us, etc. The emphasis rests on ‘each one of us,’ not on ‘of himself,’ or, ‘to God.’ There is no exception; let each remember this, and each will be guarded against judging his brother. ‘That which precedes means: “Do not judge thy brother, since God will judge  him;” this verse means: “Judge thou thyself, since God will judge  thee.”‘ (Godet.)
