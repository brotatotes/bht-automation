Romans 14:13.  Let us not therefore judge one another any more. Both classes are here addressed, since Romans 14:12, to which ‘therefore’ refers, included both; ‘one another’ points back to ‘of himself’ in the same verse. The clause, however, furnishes a transition to the exhortation to the strong.
	 But judge this rather, not to put, etc. There is a play on the word ‘judge,’ which here has the sense of forming a judgment as a principle of action.
	 A stumbling block or an occasion of falling. Evidently this is addressed to those whose freer conduct gave offence to the weak brethren. The two expressions are regarded by many as synonymous, or the second as explanatory of the first. Godet refers ‘stumbling block’ to that which grieves the weak brother, and ‘occasion of falling’ to that which may lead him to sin by enticing him to act against his conscience. This view is favored by the fact that the section discusses these two forms of offence.
	 In a brother’s way.  Fellow Christians are spoken to and spoken of. The principle does not apply to all men, to the same extent. The ‘brother  ’  is assumed to have a conscience more enlightened than that of an unbeliever, whose judgment and ground of offence cannot therefore have the same weight.
