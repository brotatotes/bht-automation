Romans 14:14.  I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus. His knowledge on the point in question amounts to full conviction growing out of his fellowship with Christ. The principle which he thus prefaces is:  that nothing is unclean, lit., ‘common,’ impure, according to the distinction made by the Jews, and ascetics generally, of itself,  i.e., by nature. (See marg. refs. on this point.) There is some doubt about the correct reading of this phrase, but the sense is well established. Paul thus declares that the freer brethren are in the right, these distinctions are not valid theoretically; but practically an exception must be made, which the Apostle enforced on the ground of love (Romans 14:15).
	But, or, ‘except.’ If the latter sense be accepted, the exception holds good in regard to ‘unclean,’ not to ‘unclean of itself.’
	 To him that reckoneth, etc. ‘Reckoneth’ is the word used of justification, it points to a judgment, not to moral quality.
	 To him it is unclean; the emphasis rests on ‘to him;’ his scruple makes it so for him.
