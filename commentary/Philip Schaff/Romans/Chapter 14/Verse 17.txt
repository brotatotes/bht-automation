Romans 14:17.  For the kingdom of God.  This kingdom is ‘God’s dominion over the heart, instituted and administered by Christ; it is the heavenly sphere of life, in which God’s word and Spirit govern, and whose organ on the earth is the Church’ (Lange). To refer it here to the future Messianic kingdom seems impossible. If the previous verse refers to Christian liberty, then this verse urges a limitation of it, because nothing essential to the kingdom is involved in this restriction. But if all are addressed, then the motive is derived from the wrong estimate of Christianity which would be formed by those without who blasphemed their ‘good.’ As what follows has a special fitness for the  weak  brethren, the latter view is further sustained.
	 Is not eating and drinking; the act of eating and drinking, not, food (as in Romans 14:15; Romans 14:20).
	 But righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.  Two views: (1.) ‘Righteousness’ from God (= justification), ‘peace’ with God (= reconciliation) ‘joy in the Holy Spirit,’ produced by fellowship with the Holy Spirit; these are named as the essential matters in the kingdom of God. This is favored by the tone of the entire Epistle. (2.) Others understand ‘righteousness’ as moral rectitude toward men, ‘peace’ as concord in the Church, and ‘joy in the Holy Spirit’ as above, but with a wider reference to the common joy of Christians. This view is favored by the context, especially Romans 14:18-19, and by the practical nature of the entire passage.
