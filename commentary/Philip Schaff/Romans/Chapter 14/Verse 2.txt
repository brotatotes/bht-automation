Romans 14:2.  One man; as in Romans 14:5. ‘For’ is not found in the original
	 Hath faith to eat all things. ‘Believeth’ is literal, but the reference to ‘faith’ throughout makes this paraphrase necessary. One has a confidence resulting from faith which permits him to eat every kind of food. This is the first point of difference, and the position of the majority naturally comes first.
	 But he that is weak, eateth herbs. (See above.) This is best taken in its exact sense; the scruple was such that only vegetables were eaten. Even bread, prepared by others, may have been deemed unclean. But there may have been a variety of usage among the weak brethren. Such believers are apt to differ among themselves, as well as with their stronger brethren.
