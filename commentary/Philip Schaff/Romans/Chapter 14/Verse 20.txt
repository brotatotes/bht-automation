Romans 14:20.  Do not for the sake of meat undo  (or, ‘pull down’)  the work of God.  The verb ‘pull down’ is in contrast with ‘edification,’ upbuilding. Hence it is most natural to refer ‘the work of God’ to the Christian brother (as in Romans 14:15), but here in his relation to God as the author of his spiritual life. (Other explanations: Christian faith, the extension of the kingdom of God, the fellowship of faith.) To abuse Christian liberty is to fight against God.
	 All things indeed are clean  (comp. Romans 14:14);  but it is evil for the man who eateth with  (lit., ‘through’)  offence.  The exhortation is addressed to the strong brother, whose principle is admitted to be correct; but it does not follow that ‘the man who eateth with offence’ is the freer Christian who gives offence by eating. This gives to the phrase ‘through offence’ a very forced sense, it is rather the weak brother who is led by the example of the strong brother to eat  against his own conscientious scruple.  In such a case, according to the principle of Romans 14:14, it is evil to him. This is here urged upon the stronger brother as a motive, not to eat. This agrees best with what precedes, and is as accordant with the next verse as the other view.
