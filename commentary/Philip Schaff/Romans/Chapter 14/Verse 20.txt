<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:20">Romans 14:20</span>. <strong> Do not for the sake of meat undo </strong> (or, ‘pull down’) <strong> the work of God. </strong> The verb ‘pull down’ is in contrast with ‘edification,’ upbuilding. Hence it is most natural to refer ‘the work of God’ to the Christian brother (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:15">Romans 14:15</span>), but here in his relation to God as the author of his spiritual life. (Other explanations: Christian faith, the extension of the kingdom of God, the fellowship of faith.) To abuse Christian liberty is to fight against God.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> All things indeed are clean </strong> (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:14">Romans 14:14</span>); <strong> but it is evil for the man who eateth with </strong> (lit., ‘through’) <strong> offence. </strong> The exhortation is addressed to the strong brother, whose principle is admitted to be correct; but it does not follow that ‘the man who eateth with offence’ is the freer Christian who gives offence by eating. This gives to the phrase ‘through offence’ a very forced sense, it is rather the weak brother who is led by the example of the strong brother to eat <em> against his own conscientious scruple. </em> In such a case, according to the principle of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:14">Romans 14:14</span>, it is evil to him. This is here urged upon the stronger brother as a motive, not to eat. This agrees best with what precedes, and is as accordant with the next verse as the other view.
