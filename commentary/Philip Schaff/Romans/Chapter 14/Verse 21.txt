<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Stumbleth. </strong> Some of the most ancient authorities omit the rest of the verse. While it is difficult to decide which is the correct reading, the preponderance is slightly in favor of the briefer form. The principle is included in the word ‘stumbleth,’ which is related to that rendered ‘offence’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:20">Romans 14:20</span>). (If the longer reading be accepted, ‘made weak’ should be changed to ‘is weak;’ the meaning being that we should avoid the weak point of a Christian brother, even when knowing that his scruple is incorrect.) A strong Christian should strive to act upon the principle of this verse, but the weak brother has no right to demand it of him; such a demand is a confession that he is wrong in his scruple. The self-denial of the strong is not a warrant for the tyranny of the weak, who should study the passages meant especially for him.
