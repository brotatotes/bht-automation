<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:22">Romans 14:22</span>. <strong> The faith which then hast, </strong> etc. The authority for ‘which’ is decisive, and this reading gives the above rendering, which does <strong> </strong> not alter the purport of the verse.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Have it to thyself before God</strong>; it is not necessary to parade it before men. This is a commendation of the position of the strong brother: keep this faith because it is well founded, but keep it to thyself, when it might injure the weak brother.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Blessed </strong> (as the word is usually rendered) <strong> is he that judgeth not</strong> <strong> himself in that which he approveth</strong>; tests and then chooses to do. The clause points to one ‘who is so certain of his conviction, that his decision for this or that course is liable to no self-judgment; he does not institute any such judgment, as the anxious and uncertain one does’ (Meyer). Christian practice ought to be out of the sphere of morbid introspection.
