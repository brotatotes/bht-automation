Romans 14:3.  Let not him that eateth set at nought  (as in Romans 14:10)  him that eateth not. ‘The self-consciousness of strength misleads into looking down with  contempt  on the weak’ (Meyer). Against this so natural tendency the Apostle cautions; in the latter half of the chapter, the duty of the strong is more fully explained.
	 Judge him that eateth. The weak brother fails to comprehend the liberty of the stronger one; his misjudgment leads to false judgment, namely, in  condemning  the person whose conduct he fails to reconcile with the scruples of his weak faith. The reference is, not to  doctrinal  differences, but to practical Christian ethics.
	 For God hath received him. ‘Did receive him’ is more literal, pointing to the time when fellowship in Christ began. This clause gives a reason for not judging (comp. Romans 14:4), though some would prefer it to both the preceding prohibitions. But it is far more pertinent to the weak brethren, since they are apt to excommunicate, withdraw from fellowship on trivial grounds of external observance, thus rejecting him whom God received. The strong do not reject, but, while tolerating, are prone to despise the weak.
