Romans 14:4.  Who art thou that judgest? Comp. chap. Romans 9:20. Evidently addressed to the weak brother, rather than to both classes.
	 Another man’s servant, lit., ‘house-servant,’ one more closely connected with the family than the other slaves, and in those times often the recipient of great and special favors from a powerful master.
	 To his own lord. ‘Lord’ is preferable to ‘master,’ to indicate the correspondence with the correct reading of the last clause of the verse, and also to suggest the evident reference to Christ.
	 He standeth or falleth. The judgment of the weak would exclude the stronger brother from his place as a Christian (Romans 14:3), hence it is most natural to explain this phrase of the continuance or non-continuance in the daily fidelity of a true Christian life. To refer it to God’s final judgment seems less in accordance with the context, where Christ’s power, not his grace, is spoken of. The passage implies that God only is the Lord of the conscience, but that is not its primary meaning.
	 He shall be made to stand; for the Lord (‘his own lord,’ namely, Christ)  is able to make him stand.  The argument is still addressed to the weak brother, who condemns the stronger one, thinks he must  fall,  if be exercises such freedom. But the Apostle asserts: the standing and falling concerns Christ who is his master, and Christ, who is able, will make him stand in his daily Christian faith and life.
