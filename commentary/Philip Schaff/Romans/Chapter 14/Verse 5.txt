Romans 14:5.  One man esteemeth one day above another; lit, ‘judges day above day;’ distinguishes one day from another, the reference probably being to the Jewish feasts and fasts. This is a second point of difference, but not so prominent as the first, which is emphasized throughout. The occasion of offence would be more frequent in the matter of eating and drinking
	 Another esteemeth every day alike; lit., ‘judgeth every day.’
	 Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. He does not say ‘spirit,’ but, ‘mind;’ the practical reason is to be exercised in the decision of matters of personal duty; the full conviction of an  educated  conscience should be sought for, not fancied spiritual intuitions.
