Romans 14:8.  For whether we live, we live unto the Lord,   i.e.,  Christ
	 We die unto the Lord; even our dying is an act of consecration to Christ
	 Whether we live therefore,  etc. The whole course of our existence here being unto Christ, it follows that in all we belong to Christ, whose divine majesty and power (Bengel) are set forth in the repetition of the word ‘Lord.’
