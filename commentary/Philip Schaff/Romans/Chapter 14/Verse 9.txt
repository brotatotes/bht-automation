Romans 14:9.  For to this end,  as described below, and including the thought of Romans 14:8,  Christ died and lived again,  or, ‘became alive,’ at the resurrection. There is general agreement as to the correctness of the briefer reading, from which the numerous variations can readily be explained. That followed in the E. V. contains two errors, and is poorly supported
	 Might be Lord of both the dead and the living. The correspondence with what precedes (‘died and   lived’) is intentional, but the two facts and classes should not be divided. God’s purpose in Christ’s death and resurrection together was that he might be Lord of the race of men, whether in the state of the dead or still living. Hence Christians, whether living or dying, belong to Him (Romans 14:8). Ephesians 4:10 contains a wider thought, which may be included here, though for the Apostle’s argument the reference to believers is quite sufficient. Notice, that the Lordship is that of the risen Jesus Christ, the incarnate Word.
