1.  Fraternal Duty in the Case of the Weak Brethren.
	The exhortation to receive the weak (Romans 14:1); the difference between the strong and the weak in the matter of eating (Romans 14:2), with admonitions to these classes respectively (Romans 14:3), especially to the weak brother who judges (Romans 14:4); the difference respecting the observance of days (Romans 14:5); the Christian attitude of both classes in their different conduct (Romans 14:6), based upon the common relation to Christ our Ruler (Romans 14:7-9); a warning to both classes in view of the accountability to God as Judge (Romans 14:10-12).
	 The caution about judging is prophetic: more divisions and discords have arisen in the Church from the questions here referred to, about which the Apostle has given no authoritative decision, than from the discussion of the truly weighty matters of the previous chapters, in regard to which he speaks so positively. Neglect of distinctively Christian truth is often joined with pettiness in Christian ethics.
