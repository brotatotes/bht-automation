<p>1. <em> Fraternal Duty in the Case of the Weak Brethren.
	</em></p>
<p>The exhortation to receive the weak (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:1">Romans 14:1</span>); the difference between the strong and the weak in the matter of eating (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:2">Romans 14:2</span>), with admonitions to these classes respectively (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:3">Romans 14:3</span>), especially to the weak brother who judges (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:4">Romans 14:4</span>); the difference respecting the observance of days (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:5">Romans 14:5</span>); the Christian attitude of both classes in their different conduct (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:6">Romans 14:6</span>), based upon the common relation to Christ our Ruler (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:7-9">Romans 14:7-9</span>); a warning to both classes in view of the accountability to God as Judge (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:10-12">Romans 14:10-12</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> The caution about judging is prophetic: more divisions and discords have arisen in the Church from the questions here referred to, about which the Apostle has given no authoritative decision, than from the discussion of the truly weighty matters of the previous chapters, in regard to which he speaks so positively. Neglect of distinctively Christian truth is often joined with pettiness in Christian ethics.
