<p>2. <em> Proper Use of Christian Liberty on the Part of the Stronger Brethren.
	</em></p>
<p>The section opens with a caution against judging (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:13">Romans 14:13</span> a), which furnishes a transition to the leading thought, namely, that our practice should recognize the principle of not causing others to offend (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:13">Romans 14:13</span> <em> b).</em> This principle is further explained and enforced: our liberty should not grieve the weak brother (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:14-18">Romans 14:14-18</span>), nor destroy in him the work of God, by leading him to do what he has not freedom of conscience in doing (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:19-23">Romans 14:19-23</span>).
