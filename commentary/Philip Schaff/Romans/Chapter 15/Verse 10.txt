<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:10">Romans 15:10</span>. <strong> Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. </strong> From the LXX., <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+32:43">Deuteronomy 32:43</span>. But our Hebrew text reads: ‘Rejoice, O ye nations, His people.’ Probably the LXX. follows another reading, though other explanations have been suggested. In any case the praise of Gentiles is predicted.
