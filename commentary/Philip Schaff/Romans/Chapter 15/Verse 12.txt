Romans 15:12.  Isaiah faith  (Isaiah 11:10); from the LXX.
	 There shall be, etc. The Hebrew is more closely rendered in our version: ‘And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek.’ But the LXX. presents the same thought in a strengthened form well suited to the Apostle’s purpose. These citations, taken from the three divisions of the Old Testament (Law, Psalms, and Prophets) confirm Paul’s view of his own work as well as furnish a motive for unity. The last clause:  in him shall the Gentiles hope,  forms a fitting conclusion. Thus through the patience and comfort of the Scriptures he had hope (Romans 15:4), and this all might have. ‘For this adoration of the Gentiles, to which the four preceding citations refer, is the fruit not only of the enjoyment of actual blessings but also and preeminently of the hope of future blessings’ (Godet).
