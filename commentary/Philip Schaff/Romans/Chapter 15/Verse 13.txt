<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:13">Romans 15:13</span>. <strong> Now the God of hope, </strong> etc. Most aptly is God here called the God of hope (comp. the similar repetition, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:4-5">Romans 15:4-5</span>), the God who produces the hope they possess. ‘As <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:1-4">Romans 15:1-4</span> passed into a blessing (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:5-6">Romans 15:5-6</span>), so now the hortatory discourse, begun afresh in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:7">Romans 15:7</span>, passes into a blessing, which forms, at the same time, the close of the entire section (from chap. 14 onwards).

<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> With all joy and peace. </strong> These are based on hope, but are the direct fruit of <strong> believing.
	</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"> The end of this being filled with joy and peace is the increase in turn of hope: <strong> that ye may abound in hope</strong>; and this not by their own power, but <strong> in the power of the Holy Spirit. </strong> ‘Believing,’ is the subjective state, but this is the objective means, the <em> inworking </em> power. As the Holy Spirit is the author of peace, and as faith and hope, peace and joy, are the greatest helps to true unity, this benediction is a fitting close to the exhortation respecting mutual forbearance and true fellowship, which forms the most striking passage in the practical part of the Epistle. The Apostle’s main task is now completed; he prepares at once for the conclusion of his letter.
