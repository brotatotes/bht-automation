Romans 15:15.  But  (though I am convinced of this, yet),  brethren I have written  (lit., ‘I wrote,’ in this Epistle)  the more boldly (in contrast with the assurance of Romans 15:14 respecting their goodness, etc.)  unto you in some measure;   i.e., in special places; the phrase qualifies the verb, not ‘more boldly’ as if the sense were: ‘somewhat too boldly.’
	 As putting you in remembrance again; simply as one who reminds you.
	 Because of the grace that was given,  etc. His apostolic office is referred to in this phrase (comp. marginal references); this was the ground and reason of his boldness. But notice the humility of the great Apostle.
