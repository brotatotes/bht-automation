<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> A minister; </strong> not the word usually so rendered (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:8">Romans 15:8</span>), but one applied to a minister in public worship (our word ‘liturgy’ is allied to this); it is more closely defined by what follows.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Ministering as a priest in the gospel of God. </strong> The word ‘ministering’ does not correspond with the previous one, but distinctly expresses priestly service. But the gospel is not the offering, but in his preaching of the gospel he renders priestly service, and in this way: <strong> That the offering of the Gentiles, </strong> the offering consisting of them, <strong> might be acceptable, being sanctified in the Holy Spirit; </strong> not consecrated after the Levitical ritual, but truly by means of the indwelling Spirit. This verse is properly used to oppose the idea that the Christian ministry is a priesthood. If the Apostle had laid any claim to sacerdotal functions, or designed to give any warrant for such claim on the part of Christian ministers, he would not have expressed himself as he does here. The offering is figurative; the priestly functions are figurative. ‘This is my priesthood, to preach the gospel. My knife is the word, ye are the sacrifice’ (The ophylact). ‘With such sacrifices God is well pleased.’
