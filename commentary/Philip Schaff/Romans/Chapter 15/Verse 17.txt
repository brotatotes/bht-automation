Romans 15:17.  I have therefore my  (lit., ‘the’)  glorying;  the same word we render ‘boasting’ in chap. Romans 3:27; here used in a good sense.

This verse furnishes a transition to the statement of the principle governing his labors (Romans 15:17-21, the carrying out of which had hindered him from visiting Rome (Romans 15:22).
