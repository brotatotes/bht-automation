<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:17">Romans 15:17</span>. <strong> I have therefore my </strong> (lit., ‘the’) <strong> glorying; </strong> the same word we render ‘boasting’ in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:27">Romans 3:27</span>; here used in a good sense.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> In </strong> (not, ‘through’) <strong> Christ Jesus</strong>; only in fellowship with Him can he glory; thus incidentally opposing the thought that his glorying was in himself.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> In those things which pertain to God, </strong> lit., ‘the things toward God,’ referring to his ‘ministering as a priest,’ etc. (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:16">Romans 15:16</span>). It does not limit, but defines the ‘glorying.’ The explanation: ‘I have offerings for God, namely, Gentile converts,’ seems far-fetched. This verse furnishes a transition to the statement of the principle governing his labors (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:17-21">Romans 15:17-21</span>, the carrying out of which had hindered him from visiting Rome (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:22">Romans 15:22</span>).
