Romans 15:19.  In the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit.  Some authorities read ‘Spirit of God,’ and the Vatican manuscript has ‘Spirit’ alone; but the best established form is as above. The two clauses are parallel, and should be closely joined with what precedes. Christ wrought through him, in word and work, in virtue of these powers; that proceeding from (miraculous) signs and wonders, and that which came from the Holy Spirit working through him on the minds of men.
	 So that from Jerusalem,  the actual starting point of his apostolical labors (Acts 4:28-29; Acts 22:18),  round about,  not in the arc of a circle, but in a   wide circuit, round about Jerusalem.

But it is quite probable that during the journey mentioned in Acts 20:1-3 (just before the writing of this Epistle) he actually entered that region.
	 I have fully preached  (lit., ‘have fulfilled’)  the gospel of Christ.  The E. V. fairly presents the sense, though a   variety of other explanations have been suggested,  e. g.,  have given the gospel its full dimensions, completely proclaimed it, accomplished everything with it, etc. He had fully spread the glad tidings and with success everywhere, sufficient to attest his apostolic mission, and give him a ground of glorying in what Christ had wrought through him.
