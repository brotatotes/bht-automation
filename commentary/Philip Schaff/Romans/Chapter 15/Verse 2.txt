<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:2">Romans 15:2</span>. <strong> Let</strong> <strong> each one of</strong> <strong> us </strong> (weak as well as strong) <strong> please his neighbor for</strong> <strong> his good unto edification.</strong> ‘His good,’ lit, ‘the good,’ but it seems best to explain ‘for his benefit.’ The last Phrase, ‘unto edification,’ with a view to building him up in Christian character, defines more especially wherein this ‘good’ consists.
