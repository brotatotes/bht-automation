Romans 15:2.  Let  each one of  us  (weak as well as strong)  please his neighbor for  his good unto edification. ‘His good,’ lit, ‘the good,’ but it seems best to explain ‘for his benefit.’ The last Phrase, ‘unto edification,’ with a view to building him up in Christian character, defines more especially wherein this ‘good’ consists.
