<p><strong> But, as</strong> <strong> it is written </strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:9">Psalms 69:9</span>), <strong> the reproaches of them reproaching thee fell upon me.</strong> The citation is from the LXX., which literally reproduces the Hebrew. The clause may be connected directly with ‘but;’ some supplying: ‘it came to pass,’ before it is written. In the Psalm, ‘thee <em> ’ </em> refers to God, and ‘me’ to the Messiah, or the person who is a type of the Messiah. The sufferings of Christ, according to the Psalm, were to fulfil the Father’s purpose; that this purpose was for the salvation of men gives the passage here its most appropriate application.
