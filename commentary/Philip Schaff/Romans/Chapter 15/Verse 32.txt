Romans 15:32.  That in  joy  (the emphasis rests on this phrase)  coming unto you through the  will of God  (there is considerable variation in the manuscripts, but this seems the best established reading),  I may together with you find rest.  This rendering follows the better supported reading, though the sense is not altered; some authorities omit the last clause. The reality was entirely different from this hope and prayer; but we cannot doubt that the Apostle’s arrival at Rome was ‘in joy,’ even though in bonds, since in all he submitted himself to the will of God.
