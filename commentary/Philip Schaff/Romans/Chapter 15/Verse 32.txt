<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:32">Romans 15:32</span>. <strong> That in</strong> <strong> joy </strong> (the emphasis rests on this phrase) <strong> coming unto you through the</strong> <strong> will of God </strong> (there is considerable variation in the manuscripts, but this seems the best established reading), <strong> I may together with you find rest. </strong> This rendering follows the better supported reading, though the sense is not altered; some authorities omit the last clause. The reality was entirely different from this hope and prayer; but we cannot doubt that the Apostle’s arrival at Rome was ‘in joy,’ even though in bonds, since in all he submitted himself to the will of God.
