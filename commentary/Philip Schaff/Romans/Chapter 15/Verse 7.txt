Romans 15:7.  Wherefore receive ye one another,  etc. Since this utterance of praise is so sacred a privilege, they are exhorted, strong and weak alike, to receive one another (comp. chap. Romans 14:1) in Christian fellowship.
	 As Christ  also received you.  Good authorities read ‘us;’   but the weight of evidence is in favor of ‘you,’ which here includes all the Roman Christians, not merely those of Gentile origin.
	 To the glory of God,   i.e., that God might be glorified. This is to be joined with ‘as Christ also received you,’ since Romans 15:8-9, explain this purpose of Christ’s receiving them. This is, however, a motive for receiving one another, that all may together praise God. (Comp. Romans 15:6.)
