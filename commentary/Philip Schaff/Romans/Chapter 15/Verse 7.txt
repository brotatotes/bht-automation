<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:7">Romans 15:7</span>. <strong> Wherefore receive ye one another, </strong> etc. Since this utterance of praise is so sacred a privilege, they are exhorted, strong and weak alike, to receive one another (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:1">Romans 14:1</span>) in Christian fellowship.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> As Christ</strong> <strong> also received you. </strong> Good authorities read ‘us;’ <em> </em> but the weight of evidence is in favor of ‘you,’ which here includes all the Roman Christians, not merely those of Gentile origin.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> To the glory of God, </strong> <em> i.e.</em>, that God might be glorified. This is to be joined with ‘as Christ also received you,’ since <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:8-9">Romans 15:8-9</span>, explain this purpose of Christ’s receiving them. This is, however, a motive for receiving one another, that all may together praise God. (Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:6">Romans 15:6</span>.)
