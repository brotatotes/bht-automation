<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:8">Romans 15:8</span>. <strong> For I say. </strong> ‘For’ is strongly supported, and introduces the explanation of how Christ had received both Jewish Christians (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:8">Romans 15:8</span>), and those of Gentile origin (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:9">Romans 15:9</span>): ‘the connection of the former with Christ appears as the <em> fulfilment</em> <strong><em> </em></strong> <em> of their theocratic claim, </em> but that of the latter as <strong> </strong> the <em> enjoyment</em> <strong><em> </em></strong> <em> of grace’ </em> (Meyer).

<p style="margin-left:0.24em;"><strong> That Christ </strong> (the word <strong> </strong> ‘Jesus’ is to be omitted) <strong> hath been made </strong> (not only became, but continues to be) <strong> a minister of the circumcision; </strong> <em> i.e., </em> those circumcised, as so frequently in Paul’s writings. The emphasis rests on the word ‘minister,’ which suggests the condescension of Christ, as an example of humility. His obedience to the law (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span>) may also be suggested, showing how be entered into fellowship with the weak.

<p style="margin-left:0.24em;"><strong> For the sake of</strong> <strong> God’s truth </strong> (His veracity) <strong> that he might confirm </strong> (by fulfilment) <strong> the promises made unto the fathers </strong> (in the Old Testament). Thus Christ’s receiving the Jews was ‘to the glory of God,’ showing His faithfulness, and this furnished a motive for fellowship.
