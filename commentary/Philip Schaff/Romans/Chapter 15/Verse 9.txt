Romans 15:9.  And that the Gentiles might glorify God.  This clause is parallel in form with the one immediately preceding (see the change made above). expressing another purposed result of Christ’s having been made a minister. Most commentators, however, take it as dependent upon ‘I say,’ but in different senses: I say that the Gentiles  praised  (at the time of conversion), or, ought to praise, or, do praise. But Christ’s ministry among the Jews hath this further purpose; comp. Galatians 4:5.

	 As it is written (Psalms 18:50),  For this cause I will give praise to thee  (comp. chap. Romans 14:11)  among the Gentiles  (lit., ‘among Gentiles’), etc. The quotation, made exactly from the LXX., ‘originally spoken by David of his joy after his deliverance and triumphs, is prophetically said of Christ in His own Person. It is addressed to show that among the Gentiles Christ’s triumphs were to take place, as well as among the Jews’ (Alford).
