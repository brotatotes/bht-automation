Romans 15:23-24. The construction of these verses occasions much difficulty, which was relieved by the insertion of the clause (Romans 15:24): ‘I will come to you,’ to complete the sense; decisive authority proving the words to be an interpolation. Another attempt to relieve the abruptness was made by omitting ‘for’ in the same verse; but here too the weightiest evidence is against the easier reading. We are compelled then to accept a broken construction as follows: ‘But now no more having place in these parts, and having these many years a longing to come unto you, whensoever I journey into Spain (for I hope, as I am journeying through, to see you, and to be sent forward thither by you, if first I be in some measure filled with your company)
	but now, etc. The sense would be the same, if the participles of Romans 15:23 were rendered as verbs, and a period placed after the word ‘Spain.’
	 But now.  The Apostle begins   to say that the main hindrance is removed; in Romans 15:25 he states the special reason for delay.
	 Having place.  Opportunity to carry out his principle of labor.
	 In these parts; spoken of in Romans 15:19.
	 Whensoever I journey into Spain.  Paul does not use the common Greek name   for Spain (‘Iberia’), nor even the exact Latin one. Whether this purpose was ever fulfilled is unknown, and immaterial as respects the visit to Rome in which God’s purpose, not Paul’s, was carried out in the actual visit to the imperial city.
	 Hope; not, ‘trust.’
	 As I am journeying through.  This qualifies both the following clauses.
	 And to be sent forward thither by you.  (Some authorities read: ‘from you’). He hoped to obtain companions, and doubtless other friendly furtherance.
	 In  some measure; ‘not as much as I will, but as much as is permitted’ (Grotius). Not merely complimentary.
	 Filled with your company.  ‘Spiritual satisfaction through the enjoyment of the longed-for personal intercourse’ (Meyer).
