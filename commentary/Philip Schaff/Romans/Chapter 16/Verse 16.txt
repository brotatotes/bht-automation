<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:16">Romans 16:16</span>. <strong> Salute one another with a holy kiss. </strong> ‘The meaning of this injunction seems to be, that the Roman Christians should take occasion, on the receipt of the Apostle’s greetings to them, to testify their mutual love, in this, the ordinary method of salutation, but having among Christians a Christian and holy meaning (Alford). See marginal references. The custom is still known in the Greek Church.

<p><strong> All the churches of Christ salute you.</strong> The word ‘all’ was probably omitted by the scribes, because the expression seemed too extensive. But Paul was in communication with most Christian churches; all such would feel interested in the believers at Rome, and if, as is probable, his intention of going there was known, many salutations would be in trusted to him. As he knew so well the believers at Rome which he had not visited, how well qualified he was to speak for the many believing assemblies he had himself organized.
