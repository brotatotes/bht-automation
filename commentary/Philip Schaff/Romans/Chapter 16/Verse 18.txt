<p><strong> Our Lord Christ</strong>; He is the true Master (notice the unusual form, which is supported by all the early manuscripts), yet they do not serve Him, <strong> but their own belly</strong>; a figure for sensuality. It is remarkable how often schismatics have proved their Epicureanism.

<p><strong> By their good</strong> <strong> words and fair speeches</strong>; lit, by the kind speaking and blessing. These terms refer either to the tenor and force of their words, or the former may point to the mask of kindliness, and the latter to flattery. The unctiousness of sensual hypocrites is well known.

<p><strong> Deceive the hearts of the guileless; </strong> those who are unsuspicious, unwary. How many were deceiving and deceived appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+1:15">Philippians 1:15</span>, written from Rome a few years after this. Undue severity cannot be ascribed to the Apostleâ€™s language: few earnest Christian teachers have failed to observe how apt it still is.
