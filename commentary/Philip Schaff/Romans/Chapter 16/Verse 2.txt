<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:2">Romans 16:2</span>. <strong> That ye receive her in the Lord.</strong> This is the purpose of the commendation, that the Roman believers give her a <em> Christian </em> welcome.
	</p>
<p><strong> Worthily of the saints,</strong> as saints ought to receive such an one.
	</p>
<p><strong> And that ye assist her, etc.</strong> The term used is a legal one, and hence it has been inferred that her visit to Rome was on private legal business. It is unlikely that she was travel-ling in the discharge of her official duty as deaconess.
	</p>
<p><strong> For she too</strong>, ‘she herself also,’ <strong> hath been a helper of many.</strong> The word used is an honorable one, indicating service bestowed by a superior on inferiors (patroness). It suggests here her labors as deaconess, though it may include private service.
	</p>
<p><strong> Of myself also.</strong> Where is unknown; possibly Paul had once been ill during a visit to Cenchreae, or the Apostle may have made her house his home, as in the case of Lydia, at Philippi. This commendation has the true Christian tone; what she has done for other Christians gives her a claim on the helpfulness of the Roman believers.
