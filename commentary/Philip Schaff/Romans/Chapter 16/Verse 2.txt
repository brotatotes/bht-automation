Romans 16:2.  That ye receive her in the Lord. This is the purpose of the commendation, that the Roman believers give her a  Christian  welcome.
	 Worthily of the saints, as saints ought to receive such an one.
	 And that ye assist her, etc. The term used is a legal one, and hence it has been inferred that her visit to Rome was on private legal business. It is unlikely that she was travel-ling in the discharge of her official duty as deaconess.
	 For she too, ‘she herself also,’  hath been a helper of many. The word used is an honorable one, indicating service bestowed by a superior on inferiors (patroness). It suggests here her labors as deaconess, though it may include private service.
	 Of myself also. Where is unknown; possibly Paul had once been ill during a visit to Cenchreae, or the Apostle may have made her house his home, as in the case of Lydia, at Philippi. This commendation has the true Christian tone; what she has done for other Christians gives her a claim on the helpfulness of the Roman believers.
