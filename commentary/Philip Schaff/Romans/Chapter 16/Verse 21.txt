Romans 16:21.  Timothy, my  fellow-worker, satuteth you.  That Timothy was with Paul at this time appears from Acts 20:4.
	 Lucius.  Not ‘Luke’ but possibly ‘Lucius of Cyrene’ (Acts 13:1).
	 Jason.  This may refer to the person named in Acts 17:5, as a resident of Thessalonica.
	 Sosipater.  The same name as ‘Sopater’ (Acts 20:4), and possibly the same person. All three names were frequent.
	 My kinsmen.  Comp. Romans 16:7; Romans 16:11. Here also the term probably means more than ‘countrymen.’ That Paul’s relatives should become Christians, and be associated with him, is probable enough.
