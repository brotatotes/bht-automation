<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:21">Romans 16:21</span>. <strong> Timothy, my</strong> <strong> fellow-worker, satuteth you. </strong> That Timothy was with Paul at this time appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.24em;"><strong> Lucius. </strong> Not ‘Luke’ but possibly ‘Lucius of Cyrene’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>).
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.24em;"><strong> Jason. </strong> This may refer to the person named in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:5">Acts 17:5</span>, as a resident of Thessalonica.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.24em;"><strong> Sosipater. </strong> The same name as ‘Sopater’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>), and possibly the same person. All three names were frequent.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.24em;"><strong> My kinsmen. </strong> Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:7">Romans 16:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:11">Romans 16:11</span>. Here also the term probably means more than ‘countrymen.’ That Paul’s relatives should become Christians, and be associated with him, is probable enough.
