<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:24">Romans 16:24</span>. This verse is omitted by the best authorities. The repetition of the benediction is not so unexampled as to have given offence to the early transcribers, while it might readily have been transferred from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:20">Romans 16:20</span>. No great weight can be allowed to arguments respecting the genuineness of the closing doxology (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25-27">Romans 16:25-27</span>) based upon the repetition of this benediction.
