<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:27">Romans 16:27</span>. <strong> To the only wise God, </strong> etc. We give the literal rendering, which shows the difficult construction. Efforts have been made to avoid it by rejecting to whom; but a due regard for external authorities will not permit this. We regard the opening phrase as a resumption of the doxology begun in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>, and the relative as an irregular construction. The difficult question still remains; does ‘to whom’ refer to ‘the only wise God,’ or to ‘Jesus Christ?’ Explanations: (1.) It refers to God. This is grammatically most probable, since otherwise the entire passage is left without any logical form. A change of construction is common enough in Paul’s writings; but we can hardly accept a logically incomplete doxology. ‘Through Jesus Christ’ may then be explained as meaning that God through Christ appears as the absolutely wise God (Meyer). We indicate this connection by placing a semicolon (instead of a comma) before the relative clause. The view of the E. V. (and many older versions and commentators), which joins ‘through Jesus Christ’ with ‘be the glory,’ is opposed by the presence of the relative. (2.) Many refer the doxology to Christ. The Apostle might utter such a doxology, but it seems harsh to turn the reference from the leading Person in the entire passage. (3.) Godet refers the relative to both God and Christ, urging that it is difficult to separate them in a passage like this. In chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:7">Romans 1:7</span>, ‘the two substantives are placed under the government of one and the same preposition; they might therefore here be included in the same pronoun.’ Much such interpretation is precarious. The view of Meyer seems preferable.

<p><strong> Be the glory forever. </strong> ‘The glory,’ which befits Him (see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:36">Romans 11:36</span>). ‘Be’ is properly supplied, rather than ‘is’ The latter would give a true sense, but this is an ascription of praise. The Apostle, who had dived so deeply into the riches of the knowledge of God in Christ Jesus, might well close such an Epistle by declaring that God was revealed as absolutely wise through Jesus Christ, and ascribe to Him, as such, the glory forever. And when, through the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to this gospel, the mystery of God’s love in Jesus Christ shall be make known unto all the nations, and they, through the written revelation, become obedient to faith; then to Him at whose command the message is proclaimed, and who is therein revealed as the only wise God, to Him be the glory forever.

<p><strong> Amen. </strong> They only say ‘Amen’ who labor for and await the final triumph of Him whose plan of saving grace is so fully set forth in this great Epistle.
