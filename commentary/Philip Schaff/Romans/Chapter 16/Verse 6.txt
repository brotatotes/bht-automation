<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:6">Romans 16:6</span>. <strong> Salute Mary. </strong> This is the sixth person of this name mentioned in the New Testament. Otherwise unknown, but characterized as one <strong> who bestowed much labor on you. </strong> So the best authorities, and most recent editors. ‘Bestowed labor’ points to practical activity, in charity and womanly ministrations. When preaching and teaching are meant, ‘in the word’ is usually added.
