Romans 16:7.  Andronicus and Junias,  or ‘Junia.’ It is impossible to decide which form of the latter name is correct; if the feminine form (‘Junia’) be accepted, then the wife or sister of Andronicus is meant. But the description is supposed by many commentators to favor the reference to a man.
	 My kinsman.  This may mean ‘fellow-countrymen,’ here and in Romans 16:11; Romans 16:21; but all the persons thus termed may have been actual ‘kinsmen.’ It cannot be affirmed that they were not.
	 My fellow prisoners.  When and where is unknown.
	 Who are of note among the Apostles; honorably known by the Apostles. The phrase does not imply that they were Apostles. So loose a sense of the term cannot be accepted: see Schaff,  Apostolic Church,  pp. 512, etc.
	 Who also  (  i.e.., the two persons named, not ‘the Apostles’)  have been in Christ before me.  Became Christians before the conversion of Paul; probably in Judea, since they were known to the Apostles. Paul had a nephew at Jerusalem, we learn from Acts 23:16.
