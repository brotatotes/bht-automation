<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:7">Romans 16:7</span>. <strong> Andronicus and Junias, </strong> or ‘Junia.’ It is impossible to decide which form of the latter name is correct; if the feminine form (‘Junia’) be accepted, then the wife or sister of Andronicus is meant. But the description is supposed by many commentators to favor the reference to a man.

<p style="margin-left:0.3em;"><strong> My kinsman. </strong> This may mean ‘fellow-countrymen,’ here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:11">Romans 16:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:21">Romans 16:21</span>; but all the persons thus termed may have been actual ‘kinsmen.’ It cannot be affirmed that they were not.

<p style="margin-left:0.3em;"><strong> My fellow prisoners. </strong> When and where is unknown.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.3em;"><strong> Who are of note among the Apostles</strong>; honorably known by the Apostles. The phrase does not imply that they were Apostles. So loose a sense of the term cannot be accepted: see Schaff, <em> Apostolic Church, </em> pp. 512, etc.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.3em;"><strong> Who also </strong> ( <em> i.e..,</em> the two persons named, not ‘the Apostles’) <strong> have been in Christ before me. </strong> Became Christians before the conversion of Paul; probably in Judea, since they were known to the Apostles. Paul had a nephew at Jerusalem, we learn from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:16">Acts 23:16</span>.
