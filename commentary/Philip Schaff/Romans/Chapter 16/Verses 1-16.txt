<p>2. <em> Greetings to different Persons at Rome.
	</em></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> The bearer of the letter is commended in vers, 1, 2. Then follow greetings to many individuals, and to some households or household churches. About one third of the persons mentioned are women. On the names as indicative of origin and station of the believers at Rome, see Introd., p. 12 (Romans Book Comments). Of this chapter, Chrysostom says: ‘It is possible even from bare <em> names</em> to find a treasure.’ The list shows: (1.) Paul's personal regard; (2.) The high place he accords to women; (3.) The constitution of the Roman congregation; (4.) The great influence he exerted, since so many friends were present in a place he had never visited; (5.) The undying name received from his friendly mention, is a type of the eternal blessing which belongs to those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life. Classic authors have not preserved for us the record of so many friends; the mention of their friends has not awakened so great an interest as this list of humble people whom they would have despised. On the origin and social standing of the Roman believers, as indicated by this list, see Introd., pp. 11, 12 (Romans Book Comments). Bishop Lightfoot ( <em> Philippians</em>, pp. 169-176) finds that most of the names occurring in this section occur also in the inscriptions discovered in recently excavated burial places at Rome <em> (columbaria).</em> These inscriptions refer mainly to freedmen and slaves of emperors, and it is a fair inference that some of the imperial household are included here (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+4:22">Philippians 4:22</span>). Identification of the persons is of course impossible. The names are mainly Greek (‘Mary’ alone is Jewish), but this gives no clue to the nationality, since Greek names were borne by the Hellenistic Jews. We may assume that many of those saluted here were of Jewish extraction; proportionally more than in the Roman congregation as a whole.
