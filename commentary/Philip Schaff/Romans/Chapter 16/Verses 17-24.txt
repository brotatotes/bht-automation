3.  Closing Exhortation, with Greetings from Various Persons.
	The warning of this section (Romans 16:17-20) indicates, not the presence of false teachers at Rome, but rather the danger of such persons making their appearance. The tone of the warning suggests this, as well as the fact that it occurs incidentally in a closing paragraph, instead of in the body of the Epistle. That Jewish zealots for the law were those against whom the Apostle warns is the most probable view. The description of Romans 16:18 is plainly applicable to these Judaizers, to whom the weak brethren would afford an opportunity. Romans 16:21-24 form a distinct paragraph. Most of the names are found in the Book of the Acts, but the persons may be different, except in the case of Timothy. Attempts have been made to prove that this paragraph was not destined for Rome, or is not genuine, but there is nothing in the passage itself to confirm either of these opinions.
