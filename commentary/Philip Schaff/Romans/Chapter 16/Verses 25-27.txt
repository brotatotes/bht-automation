4.  Concluding Doxology.
	In no other Epistle does the Apostle conclude with a  doxology, but this need occasion no difficulty. The passage bears every internal evidence of genuineness, and is exceedingly appropriate. ‘As a final complete conclusion, we have now this  praising of God, rich in contents, deep in feeling (perhaps added by the Apostle’s own hand), in which the leading ideas contained in the whole epistle, as they had already found in the introduction (chap. Romans 1:1-5) their preluding key note, and again in chap. Romans 11:33-36, their preliminary doxological expression, now further receive, in the fullest unison of inspired piety, their consecrated outburst for the ultimate true consecration of the whole’ (Meyer).
