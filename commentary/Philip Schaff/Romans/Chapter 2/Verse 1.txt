Romans 2:1.  Therefore.  This refers to the preceding section (Romans 2:18-29), especially to the inexcusableness of the heathen, the culminating proof of which is found in Rom. 2:32.
	 Without excuse; as   in chap. Romans 1:20.
	 O man, whosoever thou art,  etc. The application to the Jews (Romans 2:17, etc.) shows that they are now in the Apostle’s mind; moreover this judgment of others was characteristic of the Jews. But what he says is true of every one ‘whosoever’ he is (see above).
	 Wherein. ‘ In the matter in which.’
	 Another.  Lit, ‘the other;’ as it is rendered in 1 Corinthians 10:29. We would use ‘thy neighbor’ to express the thought, but the Jew would not call a   Gentile ‘neighbor.’
	 Condemnest.  There is a   verbal correspondence in the original between ‘judgest’ and ‘condemnest.’
	 For thou that judgest,  etc. This is the proof of the self-condemnation; for the judgment pronounced upon others applies to the man’s own conduct. There is a ‘reproachful emphasis’ upon ‘thou that judgest.’
	 Practisest.  The verb is the same as in chap. Romans 1:32, and in Romans 2:27; both it and the corresponding noun have  usually  a bad sense.
	 The same things.  Not the same deeds, but of the same moral quality. The censorious spirit is of the same sinful character as vice; the most moral men have sinful natures, and are kept from open transgression only by the grace of God, or by a   pride which is no less sinful than vice.
