<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:1">Romans 2:1</span>. <strong> Therefore. </strong> This refers to the preceding section (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:18-29">Romans 2:18-29</span>), especially to the inexcusableness of the heathen, the culminating proof of which is found in Rom. 2:32.
	</p>
<p><strong> Without excuse</strong>; as <strong> </strong> in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span>.
	</p>
<p><strong> O man, whosoever thou art, </strong> etc. The application to the Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:17">Romans 2:17</span>, etc.) shows that they are now in the Apostle’s mind; moreover this judgment of others was characteristic of the Jews. But what he says is true of every one ‘whosoever’ he is (see above).
	</p>
<p><strong> Wherein. ‘</strong> In the matter in which.’
	</p>
<p><strong> Another. </strong> Lit, ‘the other;’ as it is rendered in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:29">1 Corinthians 10:29</span>. We would use ‘thy neighbor’ to express the thought, but the Jew would not call a <strong> </strong> Gentile ‘neighbor.’
	</p>
<p><strong> Condemnest. </strong> There is a <strong> </strong> verbal correspondence in the original between ‘judgest’ and ‘condemnest.’
	</p>
<p><strong> For thou that judgest, </strong> etc. This is the proof of the self-condemnation; for the judgment pronounced upon others applies to the man’s own conduct. There is a ‘reproachful emphasis’ upon ‘thou that judgest.’
	</p>
<p><strong> Practisest. </strong> The verb is the same as in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:32">Romans 1:32</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:27">Romans 2:27</span>; both it and the corresponding noun have <em> usually </em> a bad sense.
	</p>
<p><strong> The same things. </strong> Not the same deeds, but of the same moral quality. The censorious spirit is of the same sinful character as vice; the most moral men have sinful natures, and are kept from open transgression only by the grace of God, or by a <strong> </strong> pride which is no less sinful than vice.
