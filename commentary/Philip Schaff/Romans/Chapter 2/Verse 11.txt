Romans 2:11.  For there is no respect,  etc. This is not a mere repetition of Romans 2:6; but shows the reason why ‘the Jew first, and also of the Greek.’ Since God has no respect of persons, He must judge the Jew  first.  The verse, therefore, constitutes a proper transition to the next paragraph (Romans 2:12-16), which sets forth that God’s judgment is according to light. The phrase ‘respect of persons’ is represented in the original by one word. The conception is from the Hebrew (to lift up, or accept, the face), and in the New Testament is always used in a bad sense, of unjust partiality. In the Old Testament it sometimes has a good sense.
