<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:16">Romans 2:16</span>. <strong> In</strong> <strong> the day. </strong> The question of connection is the important one. Some Join directly with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:15">Romans 2:15</span>;, referring the ‘day’ to the day when the gospel is preached to the Gentiles, and the demonstration of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:14-15">Romans 2:14-15</span> is made. But this verse seems to point to the future judgment. Most commentators, therefore, look for the connection in some more appropriate part of the preceding context. The E. V. loins with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:12">Romans 2:12</span>, but <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:13">Romans 2:13</span> is not parenthetical (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:13">Romans 2:13</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:14-15">Romans 2:14-15</span> are, however, and the connection with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:13">Romans 2:13</span> (‘the doers of the law shall be justified’) is even more appropriate, since it brings the discussion closer to the main thought, namely, the conviction of the Jews. (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:5">Romans 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:10">Romans 2:10</span>, which have been suggested, are too remote.) The attempt to preserve the close connection with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:15">Romans 2:15</span>, rendering ‘unto the day,’ is grammatically objectionable.

<p><strong> Shall judge. </strong> A change of accent permits the translation, ‘judgeth,’ but even the present tense might point to the great day of judgment.
	</p>
<p><strong> The secrets of men. </strong> In order to justify the doers of the law (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:13">Romans 2:13</span>), the moral quality of their actions must be determined; this is not known to men, it belongs to the secret things.

<p><strong> According to my gospel. </strong> This cannot refer to a writing called Paul’s Gospel. It was the gospel he preached, ‘my’ pointing either to the fact that he preached it, or to his special message to the Gentiles. The gospel of the free grace of God in Christ for the salvation of all that believe, revealed to him directly by Christ at his conversion and call to the Apostleship; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:7-9">Galatians 1:7-9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:11">Galatians 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:16">Galatians 1:16</span>. ‘According to’ may refer only to the fact of judgment, which his gospel declares; but this seems a <strong> </strong> weak thought in this connection. Paul was so assured of the truth of the gospel he preached that he conceives of it as presenting the standard of judgment in the great day. Nor is this an inappropriate thought. The principle of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:13">Romans 2:13</span>, it is thus indicated, accords with the gospel; furthermore, the gospel is about Jesus Christ (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:3-4">Romans 1:3-4</span>), and the judgment is <strong> through Jesus Christ</strong>, who is not only Mediator in the gospel, but Judge in the great ‘day’ (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:30-31">Acts 17:30-31</span>); and many similar passages. The Saviour is Judge; good news for those who accept Him, but a warning to those who refuse Him. Since He is the Judge, and God renders ‘to every man according to his works’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:6">Romans 2:6</span>), our good works also are through Jesus Christ, and His salvation must result in such works.
