<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:17">Romans 2:17</span>. <strong> But if.</strong> The addition of a single letter in the Greek gives this sense, which is without doubt the correct one. The construction is modified by the change; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:17-20">Romans 2:17-20</span> form the conditional part of the sentence, and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:21-24">Romans 2:21-24</span> the conclusion (apodosis) in the form of successive questions (but see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:23">Romans 2:23</span>). ‘If’ is, of course, rhetorical; there could be no doubt as to the position and feelings of the Jew.

<p><strong> Thou</strong>. Emphatic, as the original indicates.
	</p>
<p><strong> Bearest the name of.</strong> ‘Art called,’ is incorrect, ‘art named’ is not so exact as the full paraphrase we give.
	</p>
<p><strong> A Jew</strong>. The name of Judah had a religious sense, and the title ‘Jew’ was regarded as highly honorable. The title ‘Christian’ may also become a mere title.
	</p>
<p><strong> Bestest upon the law</strong>. The article is omitted, but the Mosaic law is, of course, meant
	</p>
<p><strong> Boastest in God.</strong> The verb may be rendered ‘boast’ or, ‘glory.’ The former word suggests a false glorying, arising from bigotry and conceit, and this is the sense here; but ‘glory’ would preserve the correspondence with the passage where the word retains its good sense.
