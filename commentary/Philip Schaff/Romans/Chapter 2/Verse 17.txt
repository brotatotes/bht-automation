Romans 2:17.  But if. The addition of a single letter in the Greek gives this sense, which is without doubt the correct one. The construction is modified by the change; Romans 2:17-20 form the conditional part of the sentence, and Romans 2:21-24 the conclusion (apodosis) in the form of successive questions (but see on Romans 2:23). ‘If’ is, of course, rhetorical; there could be no doubt as to the position and feelings of the Jew.
