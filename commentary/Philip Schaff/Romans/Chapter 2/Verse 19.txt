<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> That then thyself art, </strong> etc. These proud designations were not uncommon among the Jews, who deemed the Gentiles ‘blind’ and ‘in darkness.’ In proselyting they presented themselves as ‘guides’ and ‘lights.’ The history in the Acts shows how they held themselves toward the Gentiles.
