<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:22">Romans 2:22</span>. <strong> Commit adultery. </strong> The loose practices in regard to divorce (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:8-9">Matthew 19:8-9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jos+4:4">Joshua 4:4</span>), amounted to this sin, and the Talmud charges adultery upon some of the most celebrated Rabbins.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Abhorrest idols. </strong> The noun corresponding to the verb here used is ‘abomination’(<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:15">Matthew 24:15</span>, etc.), a term applied to idols.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Dost thou rob temples</strong>; or, as in the E. V., ‘commit sacrilege.’ The passage has occasioned much discussion. ‘Commit sacrilege’ seems to stand in no necessary connection with abhorring idols, whereas the robbing of heathen temples, thus making personal gain of the ‘abominations,’ would be a grievous sin. The objection that the Jews, not regarding the idol temples as sacred, would not deem it a special sin to rob them, does not seem valid; nor can the crime be deemed so singular that it would not be mentioned here. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+7:25">Deuteronomy 7:25</span> the destruction of graven images is commanded, but the robbery of the gold and silver on them is strictly forbidden. The words used in the prohibition (in the LXX.) being similar to ‘abhor’ here. Various less literal interpretations have been suggested: Embezzlement of their own temple taxes, etc.; avarice; even robbing God by seeking salvation by works (Luther). The sense we advocate makes the Jew partaker in idolatry by making gain of heathen idol worship: there is a climax, theft, adultery, idolatry, three sins so often associated in the Scriptures and in practice.
