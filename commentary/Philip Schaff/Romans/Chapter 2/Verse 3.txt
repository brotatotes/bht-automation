Romans 2:3.  But reckonest thou, etc. There is a slight antithesis here: ‘but (although this is the case, that God’s judgment is against, etc.) dost thou reckon,’ etc., have this opinion, or fancy.
	 This,  namely, what follows, the description of the man  addressed:  that thou shalt escape the judgment of God!  This seems to have been the Jewish error; according to Romans 2:2 such escape was impossible. But it is an error not confined to the Jews. ‘The sinner can persuade himself, and by many kinds of misconception stupefy himself, so as to believe that his sins will go unpunished.’ (Tübingen Bible). Ah, how common is this deception!
