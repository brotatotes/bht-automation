<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> This, </strong> namely, what follows, the description of the man <strong> addressed</strong>: <strong> that thou shalt escape the judgment of God! </strong> This seems to have been the Jewish error; according to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:2">Romans 2:2</span> such escape was impossible. But it is an error not confined to the Jews. ‘The sinner can persuade himself, and by many kinds of misconception stupefy himself, so as to believe that his sins will go unpunished.’ (Tübingen Bible). Ah, how common is this deception!
