<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:4">Romans 2:4</span>. <strong> Or despisest thou, </strong> etc. A new error. ‘The despising of the divine goodness is the contemptuous unconcern as to its holy purpose, which produces as a natural consequence security in sinning (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ec+5:5">Ecclesiastes 5:5</span> f.).’ Meyer.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Riches; </strong> referring to abundance or magnitude; a favorite expression with the Apostle, especially in the Epistle to the Ephesians (see reff.).

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Goodness: </strong> the general and positive term (taken up again), which is further explained by <strong> forbearance and long suffering; </strong> the negative terms referring to God’s tolerating sin and withholding punishment. ‘To the present hour in each life, the series of the Divine Goodness may be counted by the succession of a man’s sins’ (John Foster).

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Not knowing. </strong> ‘Inasmuch as you do not know.’ Not the same word as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:2">Romans 2:2</span>. Culpable ignorance; ignoring the fact that might be known, is perhaps implied.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Is leading thee to repentance, </strong> This is its purpose, and its tendency, but it is thwarted by man’s wilful ignorance. This verse is a question; but in the next verse, which is so closely joined with it, this interrogative form is gradually lost.
