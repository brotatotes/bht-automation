 2. The Sinfulness of the Jews, as a Proof of their Need of the Gospel.
	This passage contains the second part of the proof of the universality of sin, and hence of the universal need of the gospel, wherein is revealed a righteousness from God appropriated by faith. It begins with a direct address to one who is not named, but characterized as a Jew, and passes to a direct proof of the guilt of the Jews, not only in spite of, but also in consequence of, their greater privilege, concluding with the formal declaration that no one can be justified by the works of the law (chap. Romans 3:20). The general proof of the sinfulness of the Jews is found in chap. 2, while chap. Romans 3:1-20 presents a confirmation from the Scriptures, which it is the privilege of the Jew to possess. For convenience, we divide chap. 2 into two sections: the first (1.) setting forth the grounds of Godâ€™s judgment of all men (Romans 2:1-16); the second (II.) applying this principle to the case of the Jews (Romans 2:17-29), while (3) the Scriptural proof of their guilt is presented in chap. Romans 3:1-20.
