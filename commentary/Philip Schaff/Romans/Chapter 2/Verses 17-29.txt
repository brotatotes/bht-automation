<p><em> 2. The Jew is Condemned; His External Circumcision does not Avail.
	</em></p>
<p>This section contains the direct application to the case of the Jew, in the form of an indignant outburst (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:17-24">Romans 2:17-24</span>), much of the vehemence of which has been lost through the incorrect reading followed in the E. V.; the general principle is then applied to circumcision (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:25-29">Romans 2:25-29</span>); preparing the way for the thought of chap. 3. The stronghold of Jewish pride was the sign of circumcision, and a reference to it could not well be omitted in this rebuke of Jewish pride. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:17-24">Romans 2:17-24</span> virtually resume the thought of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:1-3">Romans 2:1-3</span>, but this thought had been enforced in the intervening verses, so that there is no abrupt change of subject. (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:17-20">Romans 2:17-20</span> form the minor proposition; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:21-24">Romans 2:21-24</span>, the conclusion of the syllogism introduced by the last section.) No man must condemn another, for the judgment is on moral grounds and according to light (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:1-16">Romans 2:1-16</span>); the Jew condemns others, proud of his religious privileges (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:17-20">Romans 2:17-20</span>); which but makes his immorality the more inexcusable (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:21-24">Romans 2:21-24</span>), and there is no escape through circumcision, since true circumcision is of the heart (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:25-29">Romans 2:25-29</span>).
