Romans 3:13.  Their throat is an open sepulchre.  Quoted accurately from the Greek version of Psalms 5:9. The reference is to sinful speech. The figure is either from the noxious odor, or from the insatiableness of an open grave. In either case, the reference is to the  corrupting  character of the speech.
	 They have used deceit.  Habitual, continued action is expressed. Hebrew: ‘their tongues they make smooth.’
	 The poison of asps,  etc. Accurately quoted from (LXX.) Psalms 140:3, latter half of the verse. The Hebrew is: ‘poison of an adder;’ but the distinction between the two classes of venomous serpents is not maintained in the LXX. The reference is to the malice which is behind the cunning of their tongues. Perhaps the thought of the poison bag under the serpent’s fangs suggests the figure.
