<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:18">Romans 3:18</span>. <strong> There is no fear of God, </strong> etc. (From <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+36:1">Psalms 36:1</span>.) ‘The transgression of the wicked is affirming within my heart: “Fear of God is not before his eyes.”‘ The quotation from the LXX. is exact. ‘Fear of God,’ reverence of Him, is here figuratively spoken of, as if it existed external to man, for a rule of life. Paul’s closing quotation reaffirms what the Scriptures everywhere teach, that the <em> source </em> of sin is a wrong attitude toward God; not to fear God is to be (and become yet more) immoral.
