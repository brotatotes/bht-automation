Romans 3:2.  Much every way.  This refers to both the preceding questions. ‘Every way’ means, under every moral and religious aspect, whichever way you look at it.
	 First of all.  This is more literal than ‘chiefly’ (comp. chap. Romans 1:8). The possession of the Old Testament was the chief advantage, but ‘first of all’ suggests that there were others, which the writer does not name here (but details in chap. Romans 9:4-5). The form of the original points to a ‘secondly’ which is omitted. (The word rendered ‘because’ is not found in the best authorities.)
	 They were intrusted with.  This is the more exact rendering.
	 The oracles of God. ‘ Oracles,’ lit., sayings, not limited to prophetic sayings. The Old Testament is meant. Even those writers who refer the phrase to the Messianic prophecies admit that these are found throughout the Old Testament, and that the possession of that book placed the ‘oracles’ in their trust. It clearly follows that the possession of the entire written revelation of God is to be deemed a greater privilege.
