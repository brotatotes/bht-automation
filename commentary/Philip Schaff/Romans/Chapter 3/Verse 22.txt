Romans 3:22.  Even the righteousness of God through faith,  or, ‘a   righteousness, however (mediated), through faith’ (Meyer); the article being omitted, as in Romans 3:21, before ‘righteousness.’ There is a contrast implied between ‘the righteousness of God’ in general, and this specific form.
	 In Jesus Christ.  Lit., ‘of Jesus Christ,’ but as He is the object of faith, the proper English expression is ‘in.’ To explain the whole phrase of Christ’s faithfulness to us, or of faith produced by Him, is opposed by Paul’s usage.
	 Unto all them that believe.  This briefer reading is supported by the four oldest manuscripts; the longer reading presents the added sense of ‘extending over.’ That this righteousness does not come to all, appears from the qualifying phrase: ‘that believe.’
	 For there is no distinction.  This assigns the reason for what precedes. There is no other way for any; all must believe, in order to obtain this righteousness. There may be other points of difference among men, but as respects this point, there is no ‘distinction’ made in God’s dealing with them.
