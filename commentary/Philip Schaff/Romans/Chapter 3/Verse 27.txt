<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:27">Romans 3:27</span>. <strong> Where is the boasting </strong> (or ‘glorying’) <strong> then? </strong> We have here an inference (‘then’) vivaciously set forth in question and answer. In view of this manifestation of God’s righteousness apart from the law, the Jew cannot boast. Such a scheme prevents any glorying; but the immediate reference to the Jew is clear from the context, as well as the use of the article. The Jewish attitude was well known; hence the question is not abrupt. ‘Glorying’ would cover both the good and bad senses of the Greek term, which, however, has here the bad sense, namely, ‘boasting.’ In chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:2">Romans 4:2</span> another, but similar word is used.

<p><strong> By what kind of a law? </strong> This refers to the exclusion, which must have taken place according to some rule or principle revealed by God; ‘law’ being here used in its widest sense, of any expression of the will of God.

<p><strong> A</strong> <strong> law of</strong> <strong> faith; </strong> <em> i.e.</em>, a law that requires faith. ‘The contrast is not here between the law and the gospel as two dispensations, but between the law of works and the law of faith, whether found under the law or the gospel, or (if the case admitted) anywhere else. This is evident by the Apostle proving below that <em> Abraham was justified</em>, not by works, so as to have whereof to boast, but by faith’ (Alford). ‘If we were saved by our own works, we might put the crown upon our own heads. But the law of faith, the way of justification by faith, doth forever exclude boasting .... therefore it is most for God’s glory, that thus we should be justified’ (Mathew Henry).
