<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:28">Romans 3:28</span>. <strong> For we reckon. </strong> This reading is supported by the most ancient authorities (with the exception of the Vatican MSS.). It suggests the reason for the previous assertion: Glorying is excluded by the law of faith, for (we have already proved and hence) we reckon, etc. The common reading makes this verse an inference. ‘Reckon’ is the word usually so rendered; ‘conclude’ is incorrect, in any case.

<p><strong> By faith apart from the works of the law. </strong> This principle has already been established (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:21-26">Romans 3:21-26</span>); and is re-stated here to furnish a basis for the argument against the pride of the Jew. Luther here adds ‘alone,’ and the phrase ‘faith alone’ has been a watchword of evangelical Protestantism. Certainly, the context excludes every other ground of justification and because it does there was no necessity for Paul’s writing ‘alone,’ or for our inserting it. The emphasis rests on ‘faith,’ which ‘is the alone instrument of justification; yet it is not alone in the person justified, but is ever accompanied with all other saving graces, and is no dead faith, but worketh by love.’ (Westminster Confession.) On ‘works of the law,’ see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:20">Romans 3:20</span>.
