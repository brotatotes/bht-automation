Romans 3:29.  Or is God the God of  Jews only? ‘ Or,’ which is omitted in the E. V., presents an alternative, in case the principle of Romans 3:28 should be doubted. ‘Belong to Jews only’ is the full sense. The Jews made this claim, and it would hold good, if justification were by works of the law, since the Jews alone possessed the law.
	 Yes, of Gentiles also.  Paul’s position as an Apostle to the Gentiles, the revelation of the universality of the gospel made to him, confirmed the promise of the Old Testament (Romans 1:1-5). Hence all this establishes the position of Romans 3:28, that a man is justified by faith.
