Romans 3:30.  Seeing that God is one, he who shall,  etc. (A slight change of reading gives the sentence a lively argumentative form; the word used being that translated ‘if so be that’ in chap. Romans 8:9.) The argument is pressed further to the undoubted fact ‘that God is one.’ ‘The unity of God implies that He is God, not merely of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles; for otherwise another special Deity must rule over the Gentiles, which would do away with monotheism’ (Meyer). But the unity of God’s being involves the uniformity of His method of justification. If God is one, there can be no contradictory revelations from God; hence Christianity, based equally with Judaism upon monotheism, cannot admit of being one among several religions equally true.
	 The circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith; lit., ‘the faith.’ The change from ‘by faith’ to ‘through the faith,’ may not have been designed to express any distinction, as Paul frequently uses the two phrases, ‘by faith’ and ‘through faith,’ as if they were equivalent. Some distinguish the former, as giving the general ground of justification (as opposed to that of works); the latter, the particular means, through his faith (as opposed to want of faith). To make the former imply a different position on the part of the Jew, is to oppose the whole current of Paul’s thought.
