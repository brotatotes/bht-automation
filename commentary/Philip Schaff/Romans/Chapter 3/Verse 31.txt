<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:31">Romans 3:31</span>. <strong> Do we then make void the law through faith? </strong> This verse may be regarded either as the proposition of chap. 4, or as the conclusion of the preceding argument. It is both in fact, being a transition from the doctrine of justification by faith to the proof that Abraham was thus justified. The objection to making it begin the next chapter is the form of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:1">Romans 3:1</span> (which see). But we place it in a separate paragraph. The article is wanting with the word ‘law,’ but the reference to the Mosaic law is unmistakable.

<p><strong> Let it never be. </strong> See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:4">Romans 3:4</span>. The Apostle indignantly denies that faith abrogates the law, as might be objected.

<p>N <strong> ay</strong>; or, ‘but on the contrary,’ <strong> we establish the law, </strong> cause the law to stand. Not as a ground of justification, but as itself teaching justification by faith, the next chapter giving the historical proof. This is the main point here, although there are many other reasons which might be urged in support of the statement as a general one. The law was never intended as a means of justification; it could not therefore be abrogated as such a means. In its typical character it has fulfilled its purpose; as to its moral contents, as the expression of the holy will of God, as a rule of conduct, it was perfectly fulfilled by Christ and is constantly fulfilled in the holy life of a believer. </p>
