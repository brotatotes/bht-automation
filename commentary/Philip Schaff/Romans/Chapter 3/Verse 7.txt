Romans 3:7.  But.  This reading is more difficult, but preferable. If ‘for’ were correct, it would introduce an illustrative confirmation; ‘but’ presents an objection or contrast. Yet even with this reading the thought is explanatory. God must judge the world;  but  if, etc. ‘The argument accordingly rests on the basis, that in the case put (“ then” from Romans 3:6) the relation of God to the judgment of the world would yield two absurd consequences.’(Meyer.) ‘For’ presents this as Paul’s argument; ‘but,’ as an objection met at once.
