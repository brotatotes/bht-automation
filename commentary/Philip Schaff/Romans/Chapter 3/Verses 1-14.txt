 The Justification by Faith, and the Curse of the Law.
	Paul addresses himself again directly to the Galatians with an expression of his indignant surprise at the folly of their relapse into Judaism, and passes from the historical to the doctrinal part of the Epistle, from the apology of his apostolic authority to the defence of his apostolic teaching concerning justification by faith and evangelical freedom, in opposition to the slavish legalism which would make Christ's death superfluous and useless. He first reminds the readers of their own experience which must teach them that they received the Holy Spirit not through the law, but through faith (Romans 3:1-5); and then he appeals to the example of Abraham who was justified by faith, and whose genuine children are those who believe like him (Romans 3:6-9). The law on the contrary pronounces the curse upon every transgressor, and cannot possibly justify any man, since they are all transgressors (Romans 3:10-12). Christ alone by His atoning death delivered us from this curse (Romans 3:13-14).
