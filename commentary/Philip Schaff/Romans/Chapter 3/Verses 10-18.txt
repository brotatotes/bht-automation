<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:10-18">Romans 3:10-18</span>. <strong> As it is written. </strong> This formula here introduces a number of Old Testament quotations, describing the moral corruption of the times of David and the prophets. Human nature being essentially the same always and everywhere, the description holds good universally, but the application here is to the Jews first, afterwards to ‘all the world’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:19">Romans 3:19</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+14:0">Psalms 14:0</span> the general application is most obvious, hence it is quoted first ‘The arrangement is such that testimony is adduced: 1 <em> st, </em> for the <em> state </em> of sin generally (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:10-12">Romans 3:10-12</span>); 2 <em> d, </em> the <em> practice </em> of sin in word (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:13-14">Romans 3:13-14</span>) and deed (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:15-17">Romans 3:15-17</span>); and 3 <em> d, </em> the sinful <em> source </em> of the whole(<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:18">Romans 3:18</span>).’ Meyer. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:10">Romans 3:10</span>. </p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> There is none righteous, </strong> etc. The citation from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+14:1-3">Psalms 14:1-3</span> (covering here <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:10-12">Romans 3:10-12</span>) varies from the LXX. especially in this verse, which begins with the last clause of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+14:1">Psalms 14:1</span>. Hebrew: ‘there is not a doer of good.’ LXX: ‘there is not (one) doing good, there is not even one.’ ‘Righteous’ is substituted, to contrast with ‘under sin.’
