Romans 3:10-18.  As it is written.  This formula here introduces a number of Old Testament quotations, describing the moral corruption of the times of David and the prophets. Human nature being essentially the same always and everywhere, the description holds good universally, but the application here is to the Jews first, afterwards to ‘all the world’ (Romans 3:19). In Psalms 14:0 the general application is most obvious, hence it is quoted first ‘The arrangement is such that testimony is adduced: 1  st,  for the  state  of sin generally (Romans 3:10-12); 2  d,  the  practice  of sin in word (Romans 3:13-14) and deed (Romans 3:15-17); and 3  d,  the sinful  source  of the whole(Romans 3:18).’ Meyer. Romans 3:10.  There is none righteous,  etc. The citation from Psalms 14:1-3 (covering here Romans 3:10-12) varies from the LXX. especially in this verse, which begins with the last clause of Psalms 14:1. Hebrew: ‘there is not a doer of good.’ LXX: ‘there is not (one) doing good, there is not even one.’ ‘Righteous’ is substituted, to contrast with ‘under sin.’
