<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:15-17">Romans 3:15-17</span>. <strong> Their feet, </strong> etc. Sinful doings are here described in a quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:7-8">Isaiah 59:7-8</span>. There are some omissions, as will appear from the following rendering of the original passage in the Hebrew: </p>
<p style="margin-left:7.2em;">‘Their feet run to do evil.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> And they haste to shed innocent blood;
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity;
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> Wasting and destruction are in their highways;
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> A way of peace they hare not known,
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> And there is no judgment in their paths,
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> Their paths they have made perverse for themselves;
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> No reader in it hath known peace.’
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> The sense is plain: they readily commit murder (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:15">Romans 3:15</span>); wherever they go, they produce destruction and misery (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:16">Romans 3:16</span>); the one opposite way, that where men walk peacefully, is strange to them.
	</p>
