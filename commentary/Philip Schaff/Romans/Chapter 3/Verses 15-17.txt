Romans 3:15-17.  Their feet,  etc. Sinful doings are here described in a quotation from Isaiah 59:7-8. There are some omissions, as will appear from the following rendering of the original passage in the Hebrew: ‘Their feet run to do evil.
	 And they haste to shed innocent blood;
	 Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity;
	 Wasting and destruction are in their highways;
	 A way of peace they hare not known,
	 And there is no judgment in their paths,
	 Their paths they have made perverse for themselves;
	 No reader in it hath known peace.’
	 The sense is plain: they readily commit murder (Romans 3:15); wherever they go, they produce destruction and misery (Romans 3:16); the one opposite way, that where men walk peacefully, is strange to them.
