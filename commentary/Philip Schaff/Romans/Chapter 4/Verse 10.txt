Romans 4:10.  How then was it reckoned?  Not, what was the mode in which it was reckoned, but, ‘how was he situated when this took place?’ The rest of the verse makes this clear.
	 Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.  The ‘reckoning’ took place (Genesis 15:6) at least fourteen years before the circumcision of Abraham (Genesis 17:25); consequently the latter was the Divine ratification of grace already received, not the effective cause or condition of the bestowal of grace.
