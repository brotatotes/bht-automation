<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> N <strong> ot only are of the circumcision, but who, </strong> etc. The Greek is peculiar, but the sense is easily perceived. Abraham is, indeed, the father of circumcision, but with reference to those Jews who are not merely circumcised, but also <em> believe, </em> as he did. The connection of the last idea with the historical facts respecting Abraham’s faith and subsequent circumcision is emphasized in the phrase: <strong> walk in the stops of that faith, </strong> etc. The sum of the argument is: ‘For Abraham’s righteousness through faith was attained, when as yet there was no distinction between circumcised and uncircumcised; and to this mode of becoming just before God, independently of external conditions, Christianity by its “righteousness by faith ” leads back again and continues it’ (Meyer).
