Romans 4:12.  And the father. ‘ Father’ is repeated to take up the line of thought slightly interrupted by the final clause of Romans 4:11. The full idea is: that he might be the father, etc.
	 Of circumcision.  Not of the circumcision as such, but of such as are afterward further defined.
	 N  ot only are of the circumcision, but who,  etc. The Greek is peculiar, but the sense is easily perceived. Abraham is, indeed, the father of circumcision, but with reference to those Jews who are not merely circumcised, but also  believe,  as he did. The connection of the last idea with the historical facts respecting Abraham’s faith and subsequent circumcision is emphasized in the phrase:  walk in the stops of that faith,  etc. The sum of the argument is: ‘For Abraham’s righteousness through faith was attained, when as yet there was no distinction between circumcised and uncircumcised; and to this mode of becoming just before God, independently of external conditions, Christianity by its “righteousness by faith ” leads back again and continues it’ (Meyer).
	 While in uncircumcision.  The form of the original closely resembles Romans 4:11; but the order is slightly changed. The emphasis there rests upon ‘in uncircumcision’; here on ‘faith.’
