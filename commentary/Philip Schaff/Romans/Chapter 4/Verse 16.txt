<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> It is of faith. </strong> What? Not the promise, but the inheritance, in view of the contrast in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:14">Romans 4:14</span>. Strictly speaking, we should explain, supply ‘the heirs are of faith.’

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> That it may be. </strong> The present is preferable, as indicating a continuous result which is purposed <em> by </em> God in making men heirs. ‘As the law, bringing the knowledge of guilt, works wrath, so the promise awakening faith, manifests God’s free grace, the end for which it was given’ (Alford).

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> In order that the promise may be </strong> (the present is preferable here also). This is the purpose of God in making men heirs by the way of grace; His free unmerited favor thus makes the promise <strong> sure to all the seed, </strong> <em> i.e.</em>, to all believers (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:11">Romans 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:13">Romans 4:13</span>), not only to the believing Jews, <strong> that which is of the law, </strong> but also to the believing Gentiles, who are described as <strong> of the faith of Abraham </strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:10-11">Romans 4:10-11</span>), though not descended from him. That the former class includes only <em> believing </em> Jews, appears from the fact that the Apostle is describing the ‘seed’ who become heirs <em> by </em> faith in order to manifest God’s grace. That justification is by faith, not by works of the law, has already been proved, and is here presupposed. As the believing Jew was also ‘of the faith of Abraham,’ ‘of the law,’ the contrast respects their race, not their way of obtaining the promise. This is the same in both cases (‘according to grace’), otherwise it would not be sure. </p>
