Romans 4:16.  On this account.  An inference from Romans 4:14-15 (though some refer it to what follows).  It is of faith.  What? Not the promise, but the inheritance, in view of the contrast in Romans 4:14. Strictly speaking, we should explain, supply ‘the heirs are of faith.’
	 That it may be.  The present is preferable, as indicating a continuous result which is purposed  by  God in making men heirs. ‘As the law, bringing the knowledge of guilt, works wrath, so the promise awakening faith, manifests God’s free grace, the end for which it was given’ (Alford).
	 In order that the promise may be  (the present is preferable here also). This is the purpose of God in making men heirs by the way of grace; His free unmerited favor thus makes the promise  sure to all the seed,   i.e., to all believers (comp. Romans 4:11; Romans 4:13), not only to the believing Jews,  that which is of the law,  but also to the believing Gentiles, who are described as  of the faith of Abraham  (Romans 4:10-11), though not descended from him. That the former class includes only  believing  Jews, appears from the fact that the Apostle is describing the ‘seed’ who become heirs  by  faith in order to manifest God’s grace. That justification is by faith, not by works of the law, has already been proved, and is here presupposed. As the believing Jew was also ‘of the faith of Abraham,’ ‘of the law,’ the contrast respects their race, not their way of obtaining the promise. This is the same in both cases (‘according to grace’), otherwise it would not be sure.  Who is the father of us all. ‘ Reiterated (comp. Romans 4:11-12), solemn setting forth of the fatherhood of Abraham for  all  believers (  us)  ,  which was, indeed, the pith and fundamental idea of the entire argument (since Romans 4:9).’ Meyer.
