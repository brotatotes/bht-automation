<p><strong> But not toward God. </strong> The best paraphrase of this concisely expressed passage is: ‘If Abraham, as the Jews suppose, was justified by works, he has reason to glory toward God (for he could claim justification from God as “of debt”), but he has no ground of glorying toward God (and hence was not justified by works), for the Scripture says he was justified by faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:3">Romans 4:3</span>).’ Some commentators, however, following the Greek fathers, take the clause: ‘but not toward God,’ as implying that his justification by faith gives him a ground of glorying toward God, but the supposed justification by works would give him only a pound of glorying toward men, God having nothing to do with it except to acknowledge it as justly earned. The objections to this view are that <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:3">Romans 4:3</span> would then contain a <strong> </strong> refutation introduced by ‘but’ not ‘for;’ that it is not like Paul to admit any ground of glorying toward men, much less toward God, in connection with the matter of justification.
