Romans 4:20.  Yet with regard to the promise of God. ‘ Yet,’ in contrast with the facts he ‘considered.’ (If ‘not’ is retained in Romans 4:19, this verse is not in contrast with what precedes).
	 Did not waver in unbelief.  The form here is the same as in the phrase rendered ‘in faith.’ The article points to ‘the unbelief’ which might have been expected from the facts which Abraham ‘considered.’ Some prefer the instrumental sense here: ‘through unbelief,’ but ‘in’ sufficiently suggests that unbelief would have led to such doubt or wavering as the result of his consideration.
	 Was made strong.  Instead of being ‘made weak,’ he was ‘made strong.’
	 In faith.  Some prefer here also to render ‘  through  faith,’ but ‘in faith,’ is a grammatical explanation, and accords better with Romans 4:19, where the same phrase occurs in the original (‘without being made weak in his faith’).
	 Giving glory to God.  While he gave, or since, he gave. This clause is to be closely joined with the next verse, which shows how he gave glory to God. Not words of praise alone, but every action that tends to God’s glory, may be included in the phrase, according to Scriptural usage. Here the recognition of God’s omnipotence is meant.
