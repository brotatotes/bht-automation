Romans 4:23.  How it was not written for his sake alone.  The rest of the chapter states in plain language the application of the case of Abraham to the gospel believers. Thus Paul shows that God is the God of  all  believers, and that we establish the law through faith (chap. Romans 3:28-31). The phrase ‘it is written,’ which occurs here, is not the usual one: it denotes the past historical act of writing, and emphasizes the  design  of God’s Spirit in causing it to be written; the usual phrase points to the permanent validity of the Scriptural quotation. Here, as throughout the Epistle, the Apostle insists that the whole Old Testament pointed to the  universality  of Christianity.
