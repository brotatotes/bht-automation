<p><strong> Pronounceth</strong> <strong> the blessedness;</strong> speaks the congratulation, the pronouncing blessed. The quotation is of forgiveness, of <em> not </em> being reckoned a sinner; but the Apostle takes this as equivalent to <em> the Lord reckoneth righteousness. ‘</em> It is implied by Paul, that the remission of sin is equivalent to the imputation of righteousness, that there is no negative state of innocence, none intermediate between acceptance for righteousness, and rejection for sin’ (Alford).

<p><strong> Apart from works. </strong> Since the forgiveness of sins is here indicated as a part of the reckoning of righteousness, this reckoning must be apart from meritorious works, for forgiveness and merit are opposed ideas.
