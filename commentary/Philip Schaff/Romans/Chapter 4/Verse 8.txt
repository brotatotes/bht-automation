<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:8">Romans 4:8</span>. <strong> Will not reckon sin. </strong> The negation is very <strong> </strong> strong, ‘will in no wise reckon.’ This may refer to the final judgment, but more probably points to the method of entire forgiveness (future to David’s eye) revealed in the gospel.
