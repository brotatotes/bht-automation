<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:1">Romans 5:1</span>. <strong> Therefore being justified. </strong> The connection is with chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:25">Romans 4:25</span>, but through this with the whole <strong> </strong> argument in the second division (chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:21">Romans 3:21</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:25">Romans 4:25</span>). The single act of justification is indicated in the original. The sense ‘make righteous,’ is altogether inappropriate here, destroying the whole force of the Apostle’s inference.

<p><strong> Let us have</strong>; or, ‘we have.’ The two senses are represented in Greek by two forms of the same verb, which differ only in a single letter (long or short <em> ο</em>) <em> . </em> The weight of authorities is decidedly in favor of the form which must be translated, ‘let us have.’ But there are considerations which weigh in favor of the other reading: (1.) The early transcribers frequently interchanged long and short <em> o; </em> (2.) The form ‘let us have,’ if once occurring, would be retained, because the doctrine of justification was early obscured, and this form is not so confident as the other; (3.) the exhortation seems inappropriate here. These reasons are so strong, that many who would not, in other cases, hesitate to give way to manuscript authority, here retain the reading: ‘we have.’ But it is safer to follow the better supported reading, and to give it the sense: ‘let us have peace,’ in full measure, let us accept fully what God has provided for us; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:28">Hebrews 12:28</span>: ‘let us have grace.’ The sense of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:2-3">Romans 5:2-3</span> is affected by this reading.
	</p>
<p><strong> Peace with God. </strong> Not, ‘toward God.’ <strong> </strong> We are, as a result of justification, no longer under condemnation (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:1">Romans 8:1</span>): God is at peace with us. Our feeling towards Him may and ought to correspond; but it is subject to change. God’s relation to us is the great matter; on that is based true peace of conscience. When God has accepted the believing sinner as righteous, He looks at him as in Christ, who is our Peace (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:14-16">Ephesians 2:14-16</span>). The hindrance to peace has been removed by the death of Christ; God’s wrath against our sin is removed. Peace that does not rest upon this great fact is a dream and a delusion.
	</p>
<p><strong> Through our Lord Jesus Christ. </strong> This full form gives a tone of triumph to the verse. This personal Lord has made peace, satisfied justice, removed the curse, made it possible for a holy God to be righteous in accounting righteous those, who by nature and character, are sinners. God is love, He first loved the world, but loved it <em> in this way, </em> that He gave His only begotten Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>); through this Son of His love, we have peace with God.
