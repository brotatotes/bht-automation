<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:16">Romans 5:16</span>. <strong> And not as through one that sinned. </strong> There is some (but insufficient) authority for another reading: ‘through one sin,’ A single act of sin is referred to in either case.
	</p>
<p><strong> So is the gift</strong>. It is only necessary to supply ‘is;’ though some suggest fuller explanations: ‘judgment came,’ etc., in the first clause, ‘gift’ is a different word from that in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15">Romans 5:15</span>, but refers to the same thing.
	</p>
<p><strong> For the judgment. </strong> The judicial sentence of God. The word itself may refer to a favorable or unfavorable sentence.
	</p>
<p><strong> Came. </strong> This, or some verb of motion, is to be supplied; the prepositions involving the idea of motion, or result.
	</p>
<p><strong> Of</strong>, or, ‘from,’ <strong> one. </strong> (Not ‘by.’) This may refer to one <em> trespass, </em> in accordance with the next clause, or to one <em> man, </em> namely, ‘one that sinned,’ in the previous clause. The latter is preferable; what precedes usually determines the sense of an elliptical phrase.
	</p>
<p><strong> Unto condemnation. </strong> The judicial sentence (‘judgment’), in consequence of the act of one man, resulted in ‘condemnation;’ as set forth in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12">Romans 5:12</span>.
	</p>
<p><strong> But the free gift, </strong> or, ‘gift of grace’ (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15">Romans 5:15</span>).
	</p>
<p><strong> Of</strong>, or, ‘from,’ <strong> many falls, </strong> or, ‘trespasses,’ The many sins of men could be pardoned only by a ‘free gift.’ In this sense they were the origin or occasion of the free gift. As a result this free gift <strong> came unto a righteous </strong> (or, justifying) <strong> act. </strong> ‘A righteous verdict,’ or, an act that justifies. This is not the word usually rendered ‘justification.’ But the meaning is substantially the same. The word, derived from the verb meaning ‘to account righteous,’ here denotes either, in opposition to ‘condemnation,’ the righteous decree or verdict which God pronounces on account of the perfect obedience of Christ, or, in opposition to ‘trespass’ (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span>), the righteous act of Christ on which that verdict is based. It seems improper to refer it to the subjective state of justification. See further on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span>.
