<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span>. <strong> So then </strong> (not, ‘therefore’). With this phrase, which means ‘in consequence of all this, it follows that,’ Paul resumes the parallel, summing up all the previously stated points of resemblance and difference; the design being to show how the inheritance and imputation of sin confirms, renders more certain, the imputation of righteousness and the abounding reign of grace.

<p><strong> Through one fall, </strong> or, <em> </em> ‘trespass.’ The E. V. is incorrect, since the acts, not the persons are here contrasted.
	</p>
<p><strong> It came. </strong> Some verb of motion must be supplied here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:16">Romans 5:16</span>. The E. V. (borrowing from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:16">Romans 5:16</span>) brings out the sense clearly enough, but ‘it came’ is sufficient in both clauses.
	</p>
<p><strong> Upon </strong> (lit, ‘unto’) <strong> all men unto condemnation. </strong> Here ‘all men’ without exception.
	</p>
<p><strong> So also, </strong> or, ‘even so;’ but the former is preferable.
	</p>
<p><strong> Through one righteous act, </strong> or, ‘verdict;’ the same word rendered ‘justification’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:16">Romans 5:16</span>. Here Christ’s obedience, viewed as one act, as the ground of justification, seems to be meant, yet a reference to the justifying verdict gives a good sense.
	</p>
<p><strong> Came, </strong> not, ‘shall come,’ since the Apostle is speaking of the objective side.
	</p>
<p><strong> All men unto justification of life. </strong> ‘All men’ may be taken in a <em> universal, </em> but not in a <em> Universalist </em> sense. The ‘righteous act’ which forms the meritorious ground of God’s justifying act is sufficient for all men without exception; and the Apostle speaks of it in this light. But the subjective application of it implies the receiving of it (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:17">Romans 5:17</span>) by faith. See further on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:19">Romans 5:19</span>, which contrasts the actual results as respects ‘the many’ on the one side, and ‘the many’ on the other. ‘Justification’ is here the proper rendering. ‘Of life,’ <em> i.e.</em>, leading to life, in the fullest sense; the interpretation ‘justification which is life’ confuses the Apostle’s thought.
