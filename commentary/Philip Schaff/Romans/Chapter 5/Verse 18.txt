Romans 5:18.  So then  (not, ‘therefore’). With this phrase, which means ‘in consequence of all this, it follows that,’ Paul resumes the parallel, summing up all the previously stated points of resemblance and difference; the design being to show how the inheritance and imputation of sin confirms, renders more certain, the imputation of righteousness and the abounding reign of grace.
	 Through one fall,  or,   ‘trespass.’ The E. V. is incorrect, since the acts, not the persons are here contrasted.
	 It came.  Some verb of motion must be supplied here, as in Romans 5:16. The E. V. (borrowing from Romans 5:16) brings out the sense clearly enough, but ‘it came’ is sufficient in both clauses.
	 Upon  (lit, ‘unto’)  all men unto condemnation.  Here ‘all men’ without exception.
	 So also,  or, ‘even so;’ but the former is preferable.
	 Through one righteous act,  or, ‘verdict;’ the same word rendered ‘justification’ in Romans 5:16. Here Christ’s obedience, viewed as one act, as the ground of justification, seems to be meant, yet a reference to the justifying verdict gives a good sense.
	 Came,  not, ‘shall come,’ since the Apostle is speaking of the objective side.
	 All men unto justification of life.  ‘All men’ may be taken in a  universal,  but not in a  Universalist  sense. The ‘righteous act’ which forms the meritorious ground of God’s justifying act is sufficient for all men without exception; and the Apostle speaks of it in this light. But the subjective application of it implies the receiving of it (Romans 5:17) by faith. See further on Romans 5:19, which contrasts the actual results as respects ‘the many’ on the one side, and ‘the many’ on the other. ‘Justification’ is here the proper rendering. ‘Of life,’  i.e., leading to life, in the fullest sense; the interpretation ‘justification which is life’ confuses the Apostle’s thought.
