<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:4">Romans 5:4</span>. <strong> Approval. ‘</strong> Experience’ is too wide, since it may include the whole Christian life. The term here used refers to the state of one who has successfully stood a test. In itself it might refer to the act of testing (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:2">2 Corinthians 8:2</span>), but here the result is evidently meant.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Hope. </strong> As in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:2">Romans 5:2</span>, ‘hope of the glory of God.’ But while this hope precedes the ‘approval,’ in an increased measure it is the further result of the approval. ‘The more the Christian has become <em> tried, </em> the more also will hope continually possess him’ (Meyer). Like faith and love, and every other Christian grace, hope is never done in this world, but always growing. Every enlargement of Christian life enlarges this also.
