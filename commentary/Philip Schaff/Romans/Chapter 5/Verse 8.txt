<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:8">Romans 5:8</span>. <strong> But God commendeth</strong>, or, ‘doth establish’ (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:5">Romans 3:5</span>). Probably both meanings are included; the proof is of such a character as to render the love conspicuous, and thus to ‘commend’ it. The word has an emphatic position in the original. The present tense is used, because the atoning death of Christ is the fact which remains the most striking manifestation of the love of God.
	</p>
<p><strong> His own love</strong>; possibly in contrast with the love of men, but certainly suggesting it was God’s love (of benevolence) which led to the Atonement.
	</p>
<p><strong> Toward us. </strong> To be joined with ‘love,’ and referring, as does the whole section, to Christians.
	</p>
<p><strong> While we were yet sinners</strong>. So in character, and so before God, who had not yet justified us.
	</p>
<p><strong> Christ died for us. </strong> (Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:6">Romans 5:6</span>.) His death was the ground of our justification; God’s love provided this ground, while we were yet sinners.
