<p><strong> 1. The Blessed Inward Condition of the Justified.
	</strong></p>
<p>Justification has as its proper result peace with God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:1">Romans 5:1</span>), which becomes hope of the glory of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:2">Romans 5:2</span>), is actually increased by tribulation (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:3-4">Romans 5:3-4</span>), because of God’s love (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:5">Romans 5:5</span>). This love is assured by the vicarious death of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:6">Romans 5:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:8">Romans 5:8</span>); and this is a proof and pledge that reconciled sinners will be ‘saved in his life’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:9-10">Romans 5:9-10</span>), and may glory in God who through Christ provides this reconciliation (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:11">Romans 5:11</span>).
