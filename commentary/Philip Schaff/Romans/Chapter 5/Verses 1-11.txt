 1. The Blessed Inward Condition of the Justified.
	Justification has as its proper result peace with God (Romans 5:1), which becomes hope of the glory of God (Romans 5:2), is actually increased by tribulation (Romans 5:3-4), because of God’s love (Romans 5:5). This love is assured by the vicarious death of Christ (Romans 5:6; Romans 5:8); and this is a proof and pledge that reconciled sinners will be ‘saved in his life’ (Romans 5:9-10), and may glory in God who through Christ provides this reconciliation (Romans 5:11).
