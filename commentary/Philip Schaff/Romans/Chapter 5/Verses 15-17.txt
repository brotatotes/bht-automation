<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15-17">Romans 5:15-17</span>. The parallel has been suggested, but the points of difference are brought out before the correspondence is fully stated (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18-19">Romans 5:18-19</span>). The symmetry of the clauses will appear from the following arrangement of the passage: </p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15">Romans 5:15</span> But not as the fall (trespass)
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> So also is the free gift
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:7.2em;"> Of the one man
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:10.8em;"> The many died;
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:14.4em;"> much more
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> did the grace of God and the gift by the grace
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:7.2em;"> of the one man Jesus Christ
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:10.8em;"> abound unto the many. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:16">Romans 5:16</span> And not as through one that sinned
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> so (is) the gift:
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:7.2em;"> for the judgment (came)
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:10.8em;"> from one (man or trespass)
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:14.4em;"> unto condemnation,
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> but the gracious gift (came)
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:7.2em;"> from many falls (trespasses)
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:10.8em;"> unto a righteous act (or verdict). <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:17">Romans 5:17</span> For if by the fall (trespass) of the one
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> death reigned
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:7.2em;"> Through the one;
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:10.8em;"> much more
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> will they who receive the abundance
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:7.2em;"> of the grace and the gift of righteousness
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:10.8em;"> reign in life
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:14.4em;"> through the one Jesus Christ. The question arises whether ‘much more’ expresses a stronger degree of <em> evidence </em> or a higher degree of efficacy. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:16-17">Romans 5:16-17</span> the former is certainly preferable, and probably in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15">Romans 5:15</span> also. It is not that more are saved than are lost, this cannot be; nor yet that what is gained is more than what is lost, though this is true enough; but the character of God, from a Christian point of view, is such that the comparison gives a ‘much more’ certain basis for belief in what is gained through the second Adam than in the certainties of sin and death through the first Adam.
