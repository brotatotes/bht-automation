Romans 6:10.  For the death that he died.  Lit., ‘that which he died,’ which is best paraphrased as we give it.
	 He died onto sin once for all; no repetition was necessary. This is the proof that death has dominion over Him no more: His death was ‘unto sin,’ it could have nothing more to do with Him, hence death could have power over Him no more. Some refer the clause to Christ’s expiating sin; others, to His expiating and removing it; others, in view of Romans 6:11, explain it of His being freed from sin. ‘In both cases the idea of separation is expressed; but in the case of the believer, it is separation from personal, indwelling sin; in that of Christ, it is separation from the burden of His people’s sin, which He bore upon the cross’ (Hodge). The emphatic ‘once for all’ shows that this sacrifice needs no repetition; for His dying again no reason can exist
	 The life unto God.  Christ’s life on earth was also a life ‘unto God’, but in conflict with sin and death; having triumphed over these at His resurrection, He now lives unto God in the fullest sense. This, too, proves that death has dominion over Him no more.
