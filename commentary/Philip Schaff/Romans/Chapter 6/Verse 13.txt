<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:13">Romans 6:13</span>. <strong> Nor render. </strong> ‘Nor’ = ‘and especially not.’ ‘Render’ (in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</span>, ‘present’) is preferable to ‘yield,’ since the latter conveys the idea of previous resistance; the thought is of placing at the disposal of another; probably the figure of military service is suggested.
	</p>
<p><strong> Your members, </strong> the various parts of the body which can be used in the service of sin. If ‘mortal body’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:12">Romans 6:12</span>) is taken figuratively, then ‘members’ must be taken accordingly.
	</p>
<p><strong> As weapons, </strong> or, ‘instruments.’ The former sense is more literal, and accords better with the Apostle’s usage, and with the figure of military service.
	</p>
<p><strong> Of unrighteousness; </strong> opposed to ‘righteousness,’ not simply immorality.
	</p>
<p><strong> To sin. </strong> Personified as ruler (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:12">Romans 6:12</span>).
	</p>
<p><strong> But render yourselves to God</strong>; the new and true Ruler. The command is to present them-selves entirely, once for all (the tense in the original is not the same as in the previous clause).
	</p>
<p><strong> As being alive from the dead. </strong> Regarding yourselves as those that are alive, almost = since you are. There is no reference to a battle-field, out rather to the thought of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:11">Romans 6:11</span>.
	</p>
<p><strong> Your</strong> <strong> members, </strong> etc. This is a more particular statement of the previous exhortation, corresponding with the first clause of the verse.
	</p>
<p><strong> To God</strong>; not, ‘for God,’ which disturbs the parallelism.
	</p>
