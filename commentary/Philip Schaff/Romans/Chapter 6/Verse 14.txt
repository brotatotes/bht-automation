Romans 6:14.  For sin,  etc. The future tense is that of confident assertion, and hence of consolation. It is not a new exhortation.
	 For ye are not under law,  etc. This is the reason sin shall not have dominion. ‘Freedom from the law gives you so   little freedom to sin, that it is only by the exercise of grace upon you that your freedom from sin has begun’ (Lange). Here the Apostle prepares for the fuller discussion as to the powerless-ness of the law to sanctify as well as to justify. If the reason sin will not lord it over us, is that we are not under the law, but under grace, then grace sanctifies us, not the law. (Comp. chap. 7 throughout)
