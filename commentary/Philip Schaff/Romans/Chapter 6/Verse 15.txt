<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:15">Romans 6:15</span>. <strong> What then? shall we sin, </strong> etc. This objection has been raised ever since. It is not precisely the same as that suggested in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:1">Romans 6:1</span>: there the objection was that free pardon would encourage us to continue in sin; here the objection is that freedom from the law leads to freedom in sinning. The connection with chap. 7, as well as the entire argument of chaps. 6-8, points to sanctification by grace, and forbids an exclusive reference to the grace of justification.
