<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:16">Romans 6:16</span>. <strong> Know ye not </strong> ‘I take it for granted that ye know and believe’ (Stuart).

<p><strong> To whom ye render yourselves, </strong> etc. This principle is obvious: To present yourselves as servants to any one implies service to that one: in this matter the masters are opposed, hence <strong> either,</strong>.... or, there is no third.

<p><strong> Of sin unto death. </strong> Both terms are used in the usual wide sense: ‘sin’ is personified as the master, the result of the service is ‘death,’ including all the consequences of sin.

<p><strong> Of obedience unto righteousness. </strong> Here ‘righteousness’ refers not to justification but to inwrought righteousness, not excluding the final verdict at the judgment. Meyer accepts the latter sense alone. The more exact parallelism would be: ‘of righteousness unto life.’ The deviation may be thus explained: Of our own free choice we give ourselves as bondmen to <em> sin, </em> but cannot thus give ourselves to <em> righteousness: </em> we can only yield ourselves up to God’s grace, to save us, as servants of <em> obedience, </em> unto righteousness, given to us and inwrought of the Holy Ghost (so Forbes). In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:18">Romans 6:18</span>, ‘servants of righteousness’ occurs, after ‘being made free from sin.’
