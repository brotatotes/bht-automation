Romans 6:17.  But thanks to God.  In reminding them which of these masters they served (Romans 6:16), his heart speaks.
	 That ye were the servants of sin.  ‘Were’ is emphatic; this state is past, and for this the Apostle is thankful, although this negative side of salvation cannot be separated from the positive.
	 But ye obeyed from the heart.  The moral change at conversion made their true, internal attitude that of obedience.
	 That form  of  teaching whereunto ye were delivered.  This rendering is greatly to be preferred to that of the E. V. The change to the passive suggests the Divine agency in delivering them to this ‘form of teaching.’ This phrase, literally, ‘type of teaching,’ is interpreted: (1) of Christian doctrine in general; which is objectionable, because in that case ‘type’ would be unmeaning; (2) of the Pauline teaching, over against the Judaistic forms of Christianity; (3) of the ideal, or, ‘pattern,’ presented by the gospel, the ethical rule of life it gives. The second interpretation is the best. Obedience to this type of teaching, over against legalism, is something for which to thank God; be-cause it is God’s work, and because it is worthy of thanks. It follows that it is important to know what Paul’s teaching is. The next verse should be connected more closely with this; a semicolon substituted for the period.
