<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:19">Romans 6:19</span>. <strong> I speak after the manner of men. </strong> ‘I take a figure from human relations, in thus representing Christian freedom as a bond service.’ (The phrase differs from that used in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:5">Romans 3:5</span>, but there seems to be no marked difference of thought)

<p><strong> Because of the weakness of your</strong> <strong> flesh. </strong> Because of the intellectual weakness resulting from the ‘flesh,’ which is here used in the ethical sense, of depraved human nature (see chap. 7). Others refer the phrase to moral weakness, and explain: ‘I require nothing which your fleshly weakness could not do,’ and then join it with what follows; ‘for I only require such service as ye formerly rendered to sin.’ This is open to serious objection, as lowering the moral standard presented by the Apostle.

<p><strong> For as, </strong> etc. This explains what was stated in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:18">Romans 6:18</span>.

<p><strong> Servants to uncleanness, </strong> moral defilement, <strong> and to iniquity, </strong> violation of God’s law, the two sides of ‘sin’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:13">Romans 6:13</span>).

<p><strong> Unto iniquity. </strong> This may mean: in order to work iniquity, or, resulting in iniquity; the latter, pointing to a state, rather than an act, seems preferable.

<p><strong> So also, </strong> etc. The explanation changes to an exhortation, based on the facts of their experience, both before and since conversion.

<p><strong> To righteousness unto holiness, </strong> or, ‘sanctification.’ The former would express the ultimate purpose or result, the latter the immediate result, coming into view here as a progressive state. The same word occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:22">Romans 6:22</span>, and the meaning ‘sanctification’ seems preferable there, where a further result is spoken of.
