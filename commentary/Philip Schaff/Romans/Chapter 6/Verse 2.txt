Romans 6:2.  Let it never be. Comp. note in chap. Romans 3:4. Here, as there, an indignant denial: ‘let it not be that we continue in sin.’
	 How shall we  who.  ‘We who are of such a kind as.’
	 Died to sin.  Not, ‘are dead.’ When this death ‘with respect to sin’ took place is shown in Romans 6:3-4. There is throughout an implied appeal to Christian consciousness, as witnessing the ethical change. The remission of sin, which is signified and sealed by baptism, involves a death to sin. The reference, therefore, is to the time of baptism, which, in the Apostolic church, usually coincided with conversion and justification. This is preferable to the view that the reference is to Christ’s death and our fellowship in it. Observe, that the Apostle assumes the inseparable connection between   justification and sanctification, and yet distinguishes them; the justified man is sanctified, not the reverse.
