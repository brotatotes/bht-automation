Meyer here properly calls attention to the tragical force of emphatic order of words in the original.

<p><strong> When ye were servants of sin </strong> (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:17">Romans 6:17</span>), <strong> ye were free as regards righteousness. </strong> The only freedom they had was this sad freedom as respects the right service; the deepest slavery in fact, just as to be servants of righteousness is the truest freedom. It was not that they counted themselves free, or that righteousness had no claims upon them, but that, as a terrible fact, they were uninfluenced by its demands.
