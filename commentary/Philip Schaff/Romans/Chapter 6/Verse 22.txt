<p><strong> Tour fruit unto holiness, </strong> or, ‘sanctification,’ as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:19">Romans 6:19</span>; but the latter sense is even more appropriate here. They are having fruit now, in contrast either with their having no fruit ‘then,’ or with the evil fruit in their previous condition. This fruit is of such a kind as at once results in ‘sanctification’ the progressive state, the ultimate issue being eternal life. <strong> </strong> This is to be taken in its widest sense; we already have eternal life in germ; in its fulness it is the ‘end’ of all our fruit and fruitfulness. But this end is not attained by natural laws of development; each course of conduct has its inevitable result, but for a different reason; see next verse. </p>
