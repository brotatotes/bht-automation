<p><strong> But the gift of God.</strong> The same word is rendered ‘free gift’ in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15-16">Romans 5:15-16</span>. ‘Paul does not say “wages” here also, but characterizes what God gives for wages, as what it <em> is </em> in its specific nature, a gift of grace.....

<p><strong> In Christ Jesus our Lord.</strong> Not simply, ‘through’ Him. The phrase qualifies the whole clause.
