Romans 6:3.  Or are ye ignorant.  ‘If this is doubtful, then I appeal directly to your experimental knowledge.’
	 All we  who,  referring to the same persons as in Romans 6:2; all without exception.
	 Were baptised into Christ Jesus.  ‘Into,’ in such expressions, does not point to the external element (although immersion was, and in the East still is, the usual mode), but has a far deeper meaning. Baptism into Christ  Jesus  was the sign of participation in Him, union with Him, and the Apostle asserts that they all knew that this union meant fellowship with His death,  so that they were baptised into his death; hence with Him they die unto sin. The reference to baptism does not suggest baptismal regeneration; it both connects and distinguishes baptism and regeneration, as the visible sign and the invisible grace of the renewing Spirit. ‘Let us not separate what the Lord has joined together. We ought, in baptism, to recognize a spiritual laver; we ought in it to embrace a witness to the remission of sins and a pledge of our renewal; and yet so to leave both to Christ and the Holy Spirit the honor that is theirs, as that no part of the salvation be transferred to the sign’ (Calvin).
