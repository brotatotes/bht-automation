<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:5">Romans 6:5</span>. <strong> For if. </strong> A confirmatory explanation of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>; ‘if’ being almost equivalent to ‘since.’

<p><strong> Have grown together, </strong> or, ‘been united.’ The E. V., ‘planted together,’ is incorrect; the figure is that of vital connection; ‘with <em> Him’</em> is implied in the original. Some suggest ‘grafted into’; but this is a different figure.

<p><strong> In </strong> (or, ‘unto’) <strong> the likeness of his death</strong>; <strong> ‘</strong> <em> i.e.</em>, the condition corresponding in similarity of form to His death, which has specifically and indissolubly become ours (Meyer). Our vital union with Him involves death to sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:3-4">Romans 6:3-4</span>). Others take this phrase as instrumental, <em> i.e., </em> we became united with Christ through the likeness of His death; with a latent reference to baptism. But this is grammatically less admissible than the other sense.
	</p>
<p><strong> We shall be also, </strong> etc. We shall also grow together in (or with) the likeness of His resurrection. It seems best to supply in full, so as to make an exact parallel. If the previous clause means: ‘united unto Christ through the likeness of His death,’ then this must be explained accordingly. The whole points to the certainty of the other result of vital union with Christ; newness of life as truly as death to sin. Thus continuance in sin is doubly denied.
