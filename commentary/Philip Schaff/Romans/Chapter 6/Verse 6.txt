<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6">Romans 6:6</span>. <strong> Knowing this, </strong> or, ‘since we know this.’ ‘This’ refers to what follows, the whole defining the last clause of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:5">Romans 6:5</span>.
	</p>
<p><strong> That our old man. </strong> Our sinful nature is here personified (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:22">Ephesians 4:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:9">Colossians 3:9</span>); almost equivalent to ‘flesh,’ in the ethical sense, as used in chaps. 7, 8, and elsewhere.
	</p>
<p><strong> Was crucified with him. </strong> Not necessarily at baptism, but when Christ died, in virtue of our union with Him (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>).
	</p>
<p><strong> That the body of sin. </strong> Of this phrase there are three leading explanations: (1.) The body as the seat of sin; this is contrary to the view of the body which Paul especially presents. (2.) The body, so far as it remains under the power of the old man. This is less objectionable, but seems a confusing of the literal and figurative senses. (3.) Sin is conceived as an organism, with many members; the whole is but another form of the expression ‘our old man.’ This is, on the whole, preferable, since even (2.) leads to ascetic inferences which are quite unpauline.
	</p>
<p><strong> Henceforth we should not serve, </strong> or, ‘ <em> be </em> the slaves of,’ <strong> sin. </strong> Another form of expressing the destruction of the organism of sin, which is represented as a master who holds us in bondage.
