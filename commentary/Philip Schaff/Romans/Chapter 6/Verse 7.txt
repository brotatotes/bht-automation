<p><strong> Is acquitted </strong> (lit., ‘justified’) <strong> from sin. </strong> This is the permanent result. The word ‘justified’ is to be taken here in its strictly legal sense, absolved, acquitted, freed. There are three views in regard to the meaning of ‘hath died’: (1.) <em> Physical </em> death; the whole verse being a proverb: he who has died is freed from sin. The application to spiritually dying to sin is afterwards made. Meyer modifies this view: in so far as the dead person sins no more. The reference to physical death is favored by the connection (‘for’) with what precedes. (2.) <em> Moral </em> death. But death to sin is the result, not the ground of justification. (3.) Death with Christ <em> (mystical </em> or spiritual death) justifies the sinner, frees him from its guilt and punishment. This thought is true enough, but seems inappropriate here, where the Apostle is giving a reason for <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6">Romans 6:6</span>. Besides, dying with Christ is plainly expressed in the next verse. We prefer (1.), regarding the verse as a proverbial maxim. ‘As natural death cuts off all communication with life, so must sanctification in the soul cut off all communication with sin’ (Henry).
