<p><strong> Hath dominion over him no more. </strong> It had dominion over Him, as God decreed (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:8-10">Romans 5:8-10</span>) and as He voluntarily gave Himself up to it, but there its power ended. The sentence stands independently. The transitoriness of the dominion of death is thus emphasized by the form of expression. (Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:34">Acts 13:34</span>.) Unless our Saviour is now undying, we cannot be sure of living in and with Him. </p>
