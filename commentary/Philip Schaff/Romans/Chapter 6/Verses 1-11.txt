<p>1. <em> Fellowship in the Death of Christ involves a New Life.
	</em></p>
<p>The objection with which the discussion opens, which has been repeatedly urged against the doctrine of justification by faith, shows conclusively what Paul meant by that doctrine, namely, that God accounts men righteous when they believe in Christ. Otherwise the objection would not have been raised, nor the subsequent discussion necessary. But this discussion shows that the Apostle used the terms ‘death’ and ‘life’ in the widest sense. We do not continue in sin, he argues, that grace may abound (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:1-2">Romans 6:1-2</span>), for our baptism indicated fellowship with Christ, and this fellowship is dying to sin and living to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:3-11">Romans 6:3-11</span>). The section is not so much an argument as an appeal to Christian experience. The error it opposes is extirpated by a vital and growing knowledge of the saving power of Christ in the gospel.
