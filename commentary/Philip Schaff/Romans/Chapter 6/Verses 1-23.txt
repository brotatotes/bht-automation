 3. Moral Results of Justification; those Justified by Faith live a New Life in the Spirit.
	The gospel is the power of God unto salvation; through it the will is affected, and thus is accomplished  morally what the law could not do, namely, the sanctification of those born sinners. But just here the greatest objection is raised to the doctrine of free salvation; and with this objection the Apostle begins his discussion: I. The gospel method of grace does not lead to sin but to holiness; chap. 6
	(1.) Because of what is necessarily involved in the new life (Romans 6:1-11); (2.) those who partake of this new life are dead to sin and dedicated to God (Romans 6:12-23).
	II. The relation of Christians to the law: it is in itself just and good, but powerless to sanctify; chap. 7
	(1.) Believers are freed from the law (Romans 7:1-6), but (2.) this does not prove that the law is sin; for, as it has been proven that it cannot justify, it now appears that though holy it cannot make sinners holy (Romans 7:7-25).
	III. The sanctifying work of the Spirit, the free life in the Spirit over against the life in the flesh; chap. 8 (see further analysis there).
