<p>2. <em> Christians are Dead to Sin</em>, <em> and Dedicated to God.
	</em></p>
<p>The exhortation of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:11">Romans 6:11</span> is expanded in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:12-14">Romans 6:12-14</span>; the negative part (‘dead unto sin’) in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:12-13">Romans 6:12-13</span> a; the positive part (‘alive unto God’) in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:13-14">Romans 6:13-14</span>. But the concluding motive: ‘for ye are not under the law, but under grace,' suggests another objection, namely, that this would imply freedom to sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:15">Romans 6:15</span>). This objection the Apostle answers by carrying out in detail an illustration from service. Christians are no longer servants of sin, with the wages of death; but servants of righteousness (servants of God), thus becoming sanctified, and receiving as the gift of God ‘eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.’ (The section is preliminary to chap. 7 which shows more fully that we are ‘not under the law, but under grace.’)
