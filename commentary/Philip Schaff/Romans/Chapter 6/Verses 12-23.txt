2.  Christians are Dead to Sin,  and Dedicated to God.
	The exhortation of Romans 6:11 is expanded in Romans 6:12-14; the negative part (‘dead unto sin’) in Romans 6:12-13 a; the positive part (‘alive unto God’) in Romans 6:13-14. But the concluding motive: ‘for ye are not under the law, but under grace,' suggests another objection, namely, that this would imply freedom to sin (Romans 6:15). This objection the Apostle answers by carrying out in detail an illustration from service. Christians are no longer servants of sin, with the wages of death; but servants of righteousness (servants of God), thus becoming sanctified, and receiving as the gift of God ‘eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.’ (The section is preliminary to chap. 7 which shows more fully that we are ‘not under the law, but under grace.’)
