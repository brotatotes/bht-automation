<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:11">Romans 7:11</span>. <strong> For sin</strong>, etc. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:8">Romans 7:8</span>, which resembles this, Paul explains the excitement of evil desire through the law; namely, how sin revived, but here he explains the other phrase: ‘I died.’ The word ‘sin’ is herein more emphatic than in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:8">Romans 7:8</span>. It was not in the ‘law,’ but ‘sin’ that wrought this sad result.

<p><strong> Through the commandment deceived me.</strong> These words are to be joined together, in accordance with the analogy of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:8">Romans 7:8</span>, and of the following clause. It first made the commandment a <em> provocation, </em> and then a means of <em> condemnation. </em> Thus what applies to Satan, that he was first man’s <em> tempter, </em> and then his accuser, applies likewise to sin. This passage calls to mind the serpent in Paradise, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:3">2 Corinthians 11:3</span> (Lange). To refer this to the conviction of sin which precedes conversion seems unnecessary.

<p><strong> And through it slew me</strong>. It thus led to a consciousness of the state of sin and misery referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:10">Romans 7:10</span>: ‘I died.’ The experience here portrayed has been reproduced in every age: this is the universal effect of God’s law upon sinful man whose conscience is not yet dead.
