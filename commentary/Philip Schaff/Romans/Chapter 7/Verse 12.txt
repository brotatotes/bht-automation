<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:12">Romans 7:12</span>. So that. The result of the whole discussion (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7-11">Romans 7:7-11</span>) is not to cast doubt upon the law, but to maintain its character as worthy of God who gave it. The original suggests a second member of the sentence, which is indicated in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:13">Romans 7:13</span>.

<p><strong> The law if holy. </strong> This positive character of the law Paul does not stop to prove; for the only suspicion against its holy character came from the sinful results already spoken of. But there the law was constantly condemning, which condemnation betokened that it was ‘holy.’
	</p>
<p><strong> And the commandment. </strong> What is true of the law as a whole, is also true of its single commandments.
	</p>
<p><strong> Holy and just and good, </strong> ‘Holy,’ because it comes from a holy God; ‘just,’ because of its form; ‘good,’ because of its end (so Bengel). As the specific commandment had in each case been used by sin to deceive and slay him, the Apostle gives this full declaration of the character of ‘the commandment.’
