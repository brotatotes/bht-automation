<p><strong> The law is spiritual</strong>; in its essence it is divine, because its characteristics are those of the Holy Spirit. This view agrees best with the contrast which follows.

<p><strong> But I</strong> <strong> am carnal. </strong> The change of a single letter gives, as the better reading, the word meaning, ‘made of flesh,’ instead of that meaning, ‘of a fleshly character.’ The correct reading seems to give the stronger sense, though this is denied by some, in order to defend the reference to the regenerate man. We think Paul here describes himself not as a Christian, but over against the law. For he does not use the word ‘spirit’ at all in this description, and applies ‘spiritual’ only to the law; whereas in the Christian the conflict is directly between ‘flesh’ and ‘Spirit’ (on these terms, see Excursus below). ‘It is true the situation, which the Apostle thus exhibits in his own representative Ego, was for himself as an individual one long since past; but he realizes it as present and places it before the eyes like a picture, in which the standpoint of <strong> </strong> the happier present in which he now finds himself renders possible the perspective that lends to every feature of his portrait the light of clearness and truth’ (Meyer).
