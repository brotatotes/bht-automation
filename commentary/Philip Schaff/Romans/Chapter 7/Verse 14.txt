Romans 7:14.  For we know.  This is again an appeal to Christian experience, but we cannot infer from this that the experience of the ‘I’ is distinctively Christian. This verse is a proof of Romans 7:13.
	 The law is spiritual; in its essence it is divine, because its characteristics are those of the Holy Spirit. This view agrees best with the contrast which follows. Other views: inspired by the Holy Spirit; related to the spiritual nature of man; fulfilled by those only who have the Holy Spirit; requiring an angelic righteousness, etc. Most of these are true, but not in accordance with the Scripture use of the word ‘spiritual,’ or with the context
	 But I  am carnal.  The change of a single letter gives, as the better reading, the word meaning, ‘made of flesh,’ instead of that meaning, ‘of a fleshly character.’ The correct reading seems to give the stronger sense, though this is denied by some, in order to defend the reference to the regenerate man. We think Paul here describes himself not as a Christian, but over against the law. For he does not use the word ‘spirit’ at all in this description, and applies ‘spiritual’ only to the law; whereas in the Christian the conflict is directly between ‘flesh’ and ‘Spirit’ (on these terms, see Excursus below). ‘It is true the situation, which the Apostle thus exhibits in his own representative Ego, was for himself as an individual one long since past; but he realizes it as present and places it before the eyes like a picture, in which the standpoint of   the happier present in which he now finds himself renders possible the perspective that lends to every feature of his portrait the light of clearness and truth’ (Meyer).
