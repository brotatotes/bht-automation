Romans 7:16.  But if.  This verse is a logical inference from the position of Romans 7:15. It is, however, the logic of a Christian applied to the condition under the law, or it may mark an advanced step in the recognition of the true position toward the law.
	 What I wish not, that I do.  Compare the similar clause in Romans 7:15. Here the weaker phrase ‘wish not’ is substituted for ‘hate.’ Even this negative attitude proves the character of the law.
	 I agree with the law that it if good.  ‘I agree with,’ marks an acquiescence in the high moral character of the law. This acquiescence is more than intellectual, or no conviction of sin would result. Some conviction of sin is implied, and must exist in every man awakened by the claims of the law. ‘My conduct, therefore, so far as my desire is opposed to it, appears according to this contradiction, as a proof that I concur with the law that it is beautiful,  i.e.,  morally good; the moral excellence which the law affirms of itself (  e. g., Deuteronomy 4:8) I also agree with it in acknowledging; in point of fact, I say  yes  to it’ (Meyer).
