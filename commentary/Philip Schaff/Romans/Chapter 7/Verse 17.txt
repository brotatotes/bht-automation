Romans 7:17.  How then,  or, ‘but now,’ as the case stands.
	 It is no longer I that perform it,   i.e.,  ‘what I wish not.’ I am a slave under sin, what ‘I perform, I know not’ (Romans 7:16). Both ‘now’ and ‘no longer’ are logical, not temporal; they point to an inference, not necessarily to a transition from a former condition into a state of grace. ‘I’ refers to the ‘moral self-consciousness,’ but there is as yet no indication that this state of things of itself does or can lead to anything better. The desire is powerless;   the ‘I’ is enslaved.
	 But sin dwelling in me; the master to whom I am enslaved. ‘In me’ is supposed by many to differ from ‘I,’ since Romans 7:18 explains the former as ‘in my flesh.’ The two phrases are a verbal reproduction of the apparent duality in the person who is passing through such a moral conflict. There is no sign of release, no assertion of power to do good of which the ‘I’   approves. Whether the experience be that of a regenerate or unregenerate man, the moral responsibility rests on him in whom sin dwells; the description is intended to prove the powerlessness of man under the law, not to define his responsibility.
