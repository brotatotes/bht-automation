<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:17">Romans 7:17</span>. <strong> How then, </strong> or, ‘but now,’ as the case stands.
	</p>
<p><strong> It is no longer I that perform it, </strong> <em> i.e., </em> ‘what I wish not.’ I am a slave under sin, what ‘I perform, I know not’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:16">Romans 7:16</span>). Both ‘now’ and ‘no longer’ are logical, not temporal; they point to an inference, not necessarily to a transition from a former condition into a state of grace. ‘I’ refers to the ‘moral self-consciousness,’ but there is as yet no indication that this state of things of itself does or can lead to anything better. The desire is powerless; <em> </em> the ‘I’ is enslaved.

<p><strong> But sin dwelling in me;</strong> the master to whom I am enslaved. ‘In me’ is supposed by many to differ from ‘I,’ since <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:18">Romans 7:18</span> explains the former as ‘in my flesh.’ The two phrases are a verbal reproduction of the apparent duality in the person who is passing through such a moral conflict. There is no sign of release, no assertion of power to do good of which the ‘I’ <em> </em> approves. Whether the experience be that of a regenerate or unregenerate man, the moral responsibility rests on him in whom sin dwells; the description is intended to prove the powerlessness of man under the law, not to define his responsibility.
