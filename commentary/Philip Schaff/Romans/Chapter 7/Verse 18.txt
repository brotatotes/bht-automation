<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:18">Romans 7:18</span>. <strong> For I know</strong>; not, ‘we know,’ which would point to common Christian experience. This verse proves from the experience of the man whose case is described the truth of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:17">Romans 7:17</span>.

<p><strong> In me, that is, in my flesh</strong>, in my depraved human nature; ‘flesh’ being here used in its strict ethical sense. Usually in this sense the antithesis is ‘Spirit,’ and even here that idea is implied in the spirituality of the law which produces the experience under discussion. Hence it is not necessary to assume that the case is that of a regenerate man, in order to find room for a reference to the Holy Spirit, over against the ‘flesh,’ The man under the law, whether before or after conversion, is here represented as becoming conscious that he is ‘made of flesh,’ under the conflict awakened by the law. The better desire may exist (see next clause), but <em> in every case </em> it is powerless unless the man escapes from the law to Christ.

<p><strong> For to wish is present with me</strong>, lies before me. The word translated ‘wish’ (‘would,’ A. V.) is the same throughout the passage, and preserves the same general sense, of wishing, being willing, rather than of a decisive purpose or controlling desire.
	</p>
<p><strong> But to perform that which is good is not</strong>. We follow here the better sustained reading. Wishing lies before me, but executing does not; I can and do have a desire for what is good, but I cannot and do not carry that desire into effect; this experience proves that there dwells in me, that is, in my flesh, no good thing. So far as one is ‘in the flesh,’ this is his highest moral state; only when ‘in the Spirit’ can good be truly performed.
