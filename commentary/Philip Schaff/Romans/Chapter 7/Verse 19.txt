<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:19">Romans 7:19</span>. <strong> For the good,</strong> etc. This verse is a proof of the last clause of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:18">Romans 7:18</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:20">Romans 7:20</span>, which is an inference from this verse, leads back to the statement of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:17">Romans 7:17</span>.

<p><strong> But the evil which I wish not, that I practice</strong>. This is the strongest expression of sinfulness yet made. Paul, looking back from his Christian point of view, no doubt includes more than heathen writers have done when using similar expressions, but what he says is to a certain extent the experience of every man whose conscience is affected by the law.
