<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:20">Romans 7:20</span>. <strong> But if what I wish not</strong>, etc. Since this is the case (as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:19">Romans 7:19</span> shows), then the position of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:17">Romans 7:17</span> is sustained: it is no longer I, etc. The repetition in this clause is exact, but in the phrase ‘I wish,’ some emphasis rests on ‘I.’ This is taken by many as indicating a progress in thought. But there is no sign as yet of a more hopeful condition. The progress is still toward wretchedness, despite, or perhaps because of, this increased desire.
