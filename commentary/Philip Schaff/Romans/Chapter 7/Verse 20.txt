Romans 7:20.  But if what I wish not, etc. Since this is the case (as Romans 7:19 shows), then the position of Romans 7:17 is sustained: it is no longer I, etc. The repetition in this clause is exact, but in the phrase ‘I wish,’ some emphasis rests on ‘I.’ This is taken by many as indicating a progress in thought. But there is no sign as yet of a more hopeful condition. The progress is still toward wretchedness, despite, or perhaps because of, this increased desire.
