<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:21">Romans 7:21</span>. <strong> I find than the law</strong>, etc. The literal sense of the verse is: I find then the law to me wishing (willing) to do the good, that to me the evil is present. Some refer ‘the law’ to the Mosaic law, because that has been. In mind up to this point. But it is very difficult to explain the verse on this theory. Moreover, in what immediately follows (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:22-23">Romans 7:22-23</span>), ‘law’ is used in a wider sense, and ‘the law of God’ is specified, as if the term here used had another reference. We prefer, therefore, the usual view: ‘I find then (as the summing of my experience, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:14-20">Romans 7:14-20</span>) the law (of moral contradiction) when I wish to do good, that evil is present with me.’ <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:22-23">Romans 7:22-23</span> then introduce the opposing laws which make the contradiction. (Meyer thus explains the verse: ‘I find, then, while my will is directed to the law in order to do good, that evil is present with men.’ Some prefer: ‘I find then with respect to the law, when,’ etc.)
