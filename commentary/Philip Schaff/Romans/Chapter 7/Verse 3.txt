Romans 7:3.  So then.  This being the case it follows. The verse forms a parallelism.
	 Shall be called an adulteress.  This is the formal sentence, with a definite penalty stoning (Leviticus 21:10; comp. John 8:5).
	 Free from that law;  lit., ‘the law,’ in so far as it binds her to the husband, the binding   effect of the law as respects the marriage relation. ‘That law’ is a good explanation.
	S  o that she is not an adulteress. This clause may express either the result (‘so that’) or the purpose, ‘in order that’ The latter is perhaps grammatically more exact; the purpose of this freedom was to prevent the woman from being an adulteress in case of a second marriage. In Romans 7:4 the idea of result is evident enough.
