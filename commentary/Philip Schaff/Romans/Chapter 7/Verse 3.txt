<p><strong> Shall be called an adulteress. </strong> This is the formal sentence, with a definite penalty stoning (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+21:10">Leviticus 21:10</span>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:5">John 8:5</span>).

<p><strong> Free from that law; </strong> lit., ‘the law,’ in so far as it binds her to the husband, the binding <strong> </strong> effect of the law as respects the marriage relation. ‘That law’ is a good explanation.

In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:4">Romans 7:4</span> the idea of result is evident enough.
