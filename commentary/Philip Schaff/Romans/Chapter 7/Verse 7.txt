<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7">Romans 7:7</span>. <strong> What shall we say then?</strong> Comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:5">Romans 3:5</span>. The Apostle proposes to consider the wrong inference which arises in many minds, that because the law works as described in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:5-6">Romans 7:5-6</span>, it is itself wrong.
	</p>
<p><strong> Is the law sin?</strong> Because, on account of it, we sin, as already described, is it of an immoral nature? This the Apostle indignantly denies, with the usual formula: <strong> Let it never be</strong>; and then proceeds to show how the good law occasions these results in us.
	</p>
<p><strong> Nay, but I had not known sin</strong>. The law discovers sin, and in a measure incites to it, but it is not itself sin nor the cause of sin. We take ‘but’ as ‘but on the contrary,’ for if it were not opposed to sin it would not discover it. ‘Howbeit’ is objectionable, since it concedes too much: as does Alford’s view: ‘I say not that, but what I mean is that’ ‘Known sin’ points to both theoretical and experimental knowledge of sin; the latter includes the excitement to sin which every human being feels, to some extent, when confronted with a positive precept.
	</p>
<p><strong> Except through the law</strong>. The article is wanting, and the principle applies in part to law in general, but the next clause shows that the Mosaic law is meant.
	</p>
<p><strong> For I had not known</strong>. This confirms the previous statement; the verb is different from that which precedes, suggesting a slighter knowledge; even this is denied.
	</p>
<p><strong> Evil desire</strong>; or, ‘coveting,’ to correspond with the similar verb which follows. ‘Lust’ is too specific.
	</p>
<p><strong> Thou shalt not covet</strong>. From <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:17">Exodus 20:17</span>. The objects of the coveting are omitted, for it was the evil desire itself which was made known to him by the commandment forbidding it.
