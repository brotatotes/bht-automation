<p><strong> 3. Moral Results of Justification; those Justified by Faith live a New Life in the Spirit.
	</strong></p>
<p>The gospel is the power of God unto salvation; through it the will is affected, and thus is accomplished <em> morally</em> what the law could not do, namely, the sanctification of those born sinners. But just here the greatest objection is raised to the doctrine of free salvation; and with this objection the Apostle begins his discussion: </p>
<p>I. The gospel method of grace does not lead to sin but to holiness; chap. 6
	</p>
<p>(1.) Because of what is necessarily involved in the new life (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:1-11">Romans 6:1-11</span>); (2.) those who partake of this new life are dead to sin and dedicated to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:12-23">Romans 6:12-23</span>).
	</p>
<p>II. The relation of Christians to the law: it is in itself just and good, but powerless to sanctify; chap. 7
	</p>
<p>(1.) Believers are freed from the law (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:1-6">Romans 7:1-6</span>), but (2.) this does not prove that the law is sin; for, as it has been proven that it cannot justify, it now appears that though holy it cannot make sinners holy (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7-25">Romans 7:7-25</span>).

<p>III. The sanctifying work of the Spirit, the free life in the Spirit over against the life in the flesh; chap. 8 (see further analysis there).
