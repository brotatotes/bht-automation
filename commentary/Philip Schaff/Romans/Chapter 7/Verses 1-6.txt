<p><strong> 1. WE ARE FREED FROM IT (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:1-6">Romans 7:1-6</span></strong> <strong> ); FOR, 2, ALTHOUGH IT IS HOLY, IT CANNOT MAKE SINNERS HOLY (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7-25">Romans 7:7-25</span></strong> <strong> ).

<p>1. <em> Christians are freed from the Law.
	</em></p>
<p>This section might more properly form a part of the preceding chapter. The statement of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:14">Romans 6:14</span>, which has been discussed negatively (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:15-23">Romans 6:15-23</span>), is now taken up on its positive side: Christians are not only freed from sin, but freed from the law. This state of things is here illustrated under the figure of the marriage relation: ‘your marriage with Christ, having taken the place of the dominion of the law, necessarily leads to such a dominion of God in a new life’ (Tholuck). The relation to the law (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:1">Romans 7:1</span>) illustrated by the law of marriage (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:2-3">Romans 7:2-3</span>); the union with Christ who died to the law dissolves the old relation (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:4">Romans 7:4</span>), with this result, that as, in the old relation, we brought forth fruit unto death (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:5">Romans 7:5</span>), in the new relation we are dedicated to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:6">Romans 7:6</span>). This idea of freedom from the law is the basis of the discussion in the remainder of the chapter.
