 1. WE ARE FREED FROM IT (Romans 7:1-6  ); FOR, 2, ALTHOUGH IT IS HOLY, IT CANNOT MAKE SINNERS HOLY (Romans 7:7-25  ).
	1.  Christians are freed from the Law.
	This section might more properly form a part of the preceding chapter. The statement of chap. Romans 6:14, which has been discussed negatively (chap. Romans 6:15-23), is now taken up on its positive side: Christians are not only freed from sin, but freed from the law. This state of things is here illustrated under the figure of the marriage relation: ‘your marriage with Christ, having taken the place of the dominion of the law, necessarily leads to such a dominion of God in a new life’ (Tholuck). The relation to the law (Romans 7:1) illustrated by the law of marriage (Romans 7:2-3); the union with Christ who died to the law dissolves the old relation (Romans 7:4), with this result, that as, in the old relation, we brought forth fruit unto death (Romans 7:5), in the new relation we are dedicated to God (Romans 7:6). This idea of freedom from the law is the basis of the discussion in the remainder of the chapter.
