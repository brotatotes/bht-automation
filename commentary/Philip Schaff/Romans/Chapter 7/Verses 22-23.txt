Romans 7:22-23. We have four phrases contrasted in pairs: ‘The law of God;’ ‘another law in my members,’ etc.; ‘the law of my mind;’ ‘the law of sin and death,’ etc. Each phrase has its distinct meaning, while those forming pairs are closely related: The law of God is the Mosaic law, but the law of the mind is the same law so far as it is  operative  in the mind; the law in the members is the law of sin, so far as it is operative in the members; the extreme contrast is between the law of God and the law of sin and death. ‘The law’ of Romans 7:21 is this principle of moral conflict which the Apostle found in his experience.
