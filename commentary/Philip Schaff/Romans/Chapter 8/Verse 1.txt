Romans 8:1.  There is therefore now,  at this time. ‘Therefore’ sums up what precedes. But the exact connection is disputed. It may be joined either (1.) with the thanksgiving, at the beginning of Romans 8:25; (2.) or with the whole of Romans 8:25; (3.) or with the entire preceding section. With the view we have taken of the previous description, it seems best, to connect it with the thanksgiving. Meyer finds ‘now’ explained in Romans 8:2, ‘now that Christ has freed me.’ This is really taking up the thanksgiving again. Some, who refer the preceding experience to the regenerate, explain thus: ‘Although I am thus divided in service, still, being in Christ Jesus, there is now therefore,’ etc.
	 No condemnation.  ‘No’ is in emphatic position. Some confine this to the act of Justification at the beginning of the Christian life, but it is better to refer it to the state of justification which culminates in final acquittal and glory. For here the Apostle is treating of those who are in Christ Jesus, and the context points to the Spirit’s work of sanctification.
	 In Christ Jesus.  In vital union with Him; the phrase being a deeply significant one; comp. John 15:1-7; Ephesians 1:23.
	The clause: ‘who walk not,’ etc., is to be rejected, being probably taken from Romans 8:4. This addition weakens the Apostle’s statement, by making the walk appear as the ground of ‘no condemnation.’
