Romans 8:10.  But if Christ is in you.  Not doubt, but rather a suggestion that this is the case; in contrast with the latter part of Romans 8:9. Notice that the indwelling of the Spirit of God, having the Spirit of Christ, belonging to Christ, having Christ in us, are only varied expressions of the same great fact. The underlying basis of the mystical union of Christ and the believer is the yet more mysterious unity of the Persons of the Godhead.
	 The body is dead.  This refers to the certain fact of physical death, since Romans 8:11 takes up this thought. Every other interpretation gives to ‘body’ an ethical sense, which seems unwarranted; all the more because the word ‘dead’ is not that corresponding with ‘death,’ as used by the Apostle in the wide sense.
	 Because of sin.  Not because of the special sins of the body, nor because the body is the source and seat of sin, but because the body has shared in the results of sin, and thus becomes a prey to physical death. It will ultimately share in the full blessings of redemption (Romans 8:11).
	 But the spirit is life.  Not the Holy Spirit, but the renewed human spirit, in which the Holy Spirit dwells. This is suggested by the entire context. ‘Life  , ’ not ‘alive  , ’ as if to give a more extended meaning to this side of the contrast. Hence we may include spiritual life, here and hereafter, the life eternal, beginning now.
	 Because of righteousness.  Some refer this to the imputed righteousness, but while this, as the basis of the life, is not to be excluded, the whole argument points to actual righteousness of life, inwrought by the Holy Spirit, in virtue of union to Christ.
