<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:12">Romans 8:12</span>. <strong> Therefore, </strong> or, ‘so then,’ as the phrase is usually translated; here introducing an exhortation based upon the previous statement: because the indwelling of the Spirit involves such glorious results.
	</p>
<p><strong> We</strong> <strong> are debtors, not to the flesh. </strong> ‘Flesh’ is here used in the ethical sense; the antithesis is suggested indirectly in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:13">Romans 8:13</span>. ‘Not’ applies to the following clause also: <strong> to live</strong> <strong> after the flesh. </strong> The truths of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10-11">Romans 8:10-11</span> imply that we are under obligation <em> not </em> to do this, but on the contrary to live after the Spirit. Strictly rendered, this clause is one of design, in order to live after the flesh.
