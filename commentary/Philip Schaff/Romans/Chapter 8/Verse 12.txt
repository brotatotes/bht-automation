Romans 8:12.  Therefore,  or, ‘so then,’ as the phrase is usually translated; here introducing an exhortation based upon the previous statement: because the indwelling of the Spirit involves such glorious results.
	 We  are debtors, not to the flesh.  ‘Flesh’ is here used in the ethical sense; the antithesis is suggested indirectly in Romans 8:13. ‘Not’ applies to the following clause also:  to live  after the flesh.  The truths of Romans 8:10-11 imply that we are under obligation  not  to do this, but on the contrary to live after the Spirit. Strictly rendered, this clause is one of design, in order to live after the flesh.
