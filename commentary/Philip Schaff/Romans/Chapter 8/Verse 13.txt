<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:13">Romans 8:13</span>. <strong> For, </strong> etc. If you lived thus, you would not fulfil the glorious destiny announced in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10-11">Romans 8:10-11</span>. Hence this is a proof of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:12">Romans 8:12</span>.

<p>Y <strong> e shall die, </strong> are about to die. Death in the fullest sense is here meant, not eternal death alone, and certainly not physical death, which comes to all men; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10">Romans 8:10</span>.

<p><strong> But if ye by the Spirit</strong>; the Holy Spirit, the agent of this process.
	</p>
<p><strong> Put to death the deeds of the body. </strong> ‘Deeds <strong> ,</strong> ’ <strong> </strong> or, ‘practices <strong> ,</strong> ’ has usually a bad sense in the New Testament, while the ‘body’ is here regarded as the organ of sin, having evil practices which the Holy Spirit enables us to put to death, to exterminate. The term ‘body,’ is not equivalent to ‘flesh <strong> ,</strong> ’ here or elsewhere.
	</p>
<p><strong> Ye shall live. </strong> ‘Not <em> are about to live; </em> this life being no natural consequence of a course of mortifying the deeds of the body, but the gift of God through Christ; and coming, therefore, in the form of an assurance, “ye shall live,” from Christ’s Apostle’ (Alford).
