Romans 8:17.  And if children,  also heirs.  Comp. the similar, but fuller statement in Galatians 4:7.
	 Heirs of God.  The kingdom of glory is their inheritance. ‘As He Himself will be all in all, so shall His children receive with Him, in His Son, everything for an inheritance; 1 Corinthians 3:21, etc.’ (Lange).
	 And joint-heirs with Christ.  The Roman law made all children (adopted ones included) equal heritors; but the Jewish law gave a double portion to the eldest son.

This is God’s purpose, not ours; in our case it is a result. ‘He who would be Christ’s brother and joint-heir, must bear in mind to be also a joint-martyr and joint-sufferer; not feeling Christ’s sufferings and shame after Him, but with Him, as Romans 8:10; Romans 8:32-33, declare’ (Luther). The sufferings are needed to prepare us for the glory. We suffered as He suffered, but He suffered for our sake, and we suffer for our own good; we are glorified as He is glorified, but He was glorified or His own sake, and we for His sake. His sufferings were penal, ours are purifying; His glory was His own, ours is a   gift of grace.
