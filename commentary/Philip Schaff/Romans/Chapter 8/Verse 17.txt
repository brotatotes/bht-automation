<p><strong> Heirs of God. </strong> The kingdom of glory is their inheritance. ‘As He Himself will be all in all, so shall His children receive with Him, in His Son, everything for an inheritance; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:21">1 Corinthians 3:21</span>, etc.’ (Lange).

<p><strong> And joint-heirs with Christ. </strong> The Roman law made all children (adopted ones included) equal heritors; but the Jewish law gave a double portion to the eldest son. Hence a discussion has arisen as to the exact reference in this clause. The Roman law would be naturally in the Apostle’s mind when addressing Romans, and suits the context, where adopted sonship is the basis of inheritance. The other view emphasizes the mediation of Christ, through whom we inherit

<p>If so be, etc. This is the order, not the reason, of obtaining full salvation (Calvin). There is a latent admonition in the conditional form: ‘if so be.’ On the sharing in these sufferings, comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>.

<p><strong> That we may be also glorified with him. </strong> This is God’s purpose, not ours; in our case it is a result. ‘He who would be Christ’s brother and joint-heir, must bear in mind to be also a joint-martyr and joint-sufferer; not feeling Christ’s sufferings and shame after Him, but with Him, as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10">Romans 8:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:32-33">Romans 8:32-33</span>, declare’ (Luther). The sufferings are needed to prepare us for the glory. We suffered as He suffered, but He suffered for our sake, and we suffer for our own good; we are glorified as He is glorified, but He was glorified or His own sake, and we for His sake. His sufferings were penal, ours are purifying; His glory was His own, ours is a <strong> </strong> gift of grace.
