<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:20">Romans 8:20</span>. <strong> For the creation was made subject, </strong> <em> i.e.</em>, by God, in consequence of the fall of man (see close of the verse).

<p><strong> To vanity. </strong> It became empty, lost its original significance. This does not necessarily imply a change in matter corresponding to the fall of man, but that as a result of the fall the whole creation fell away from its original design; it is probable that thus its development was checked, and it became a prey to corruption (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:21">Romans 8:21</span>).

<p><strong> Not willingly. </strong> The subjection to vanity was, therefore, not a self-subjection, <strong> but by reason of him who subjected it. </strong> The reference is to God, not to Adam: (1.) the verb is passive, implying that the subjection was intentional, which could not be true of Adam; (2.) The will of God was the moving cause, but the expression: ‘by reason of him’ (rather than ‘through him’) reverently removes this supreme will of God to a wider distance from corruption and vanity (comp. Alford). Hence we object to the interpretation: the creature submitted itself to vanity, etc.

<p><strong> In hope. </strong> Resting on hope. This is to be joined with ‘was made subject <strong> ,</strong> ’ rather than with ‘subjected it.’ Another view makes the previous part of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:20">Romans 8:20</span> parenthetical, joining ‘in hope’ with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:19">Romans 8:19</span>; this has much to recommend it, but can scarcely be insisted upon.
