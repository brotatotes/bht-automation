Romans 8:20.  For the creation was made subject,   i.e., by God, in consequence of the fall of man (see close of the verse).
	 To vanity.  It became empty, lost its original significance. This does not necessarily imply a change in matter corresponding to the fall of man, but that as a result of the fall the whole creation fell away from its original design; it is probable that thus its development was checked, and it became a prey to corruption (Romans 8:21).
	 Not willingly.  The subjection to vanity was, therefore, not a self-subjection,  but by reason of him who subjected it.  The reference is to God, not to Adam: (1.) the verb is passive, implying that the subjection was intentional, which could not be true of Adam; (2.) The will of God was the moving cause, but the expression: ‘by reason of him’ (rather than ‘through him’) reverently removes this supreme will of God to a wider distance from corruption and vanity (comp. Alford). Hence we object to the interpretation: the creature submitted itself to vanity, etc.
	 In hope.  Resting on hope. This is to be joined with ‘was made subject  , ’ rather than with ‘subjected it.’ Another view makes the previous part of Romans 8:20 parenthetical, joining ‘in hope’ with Romans 8:19; this has much to recommend it, but can scarcely be insisted upon.
