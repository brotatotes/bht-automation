Romans 8:21.  That the creation itself also.  This view of the connection seems preferable to that of the E. V. (The Greek word means either ‘that,’ or ‘because.’) We thus have the purport of the hope, what is hoped. The phrase ‘the creation itself’ is repeated in contrast with ‘children of God.’ To attribute such a hope to the creation is in accordance with the thought of the entire passage.
	 From the bondage of corruption.  The bondage which consists in corruption. The corruption results from the vanity to which the creation was subjected; it is borne ‘not willingly  , ’ and hence is termed ‘bondage.’
	 Into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.  Not only delivered from bondage, but transferred into this freedom, which consists in, or at least results from, a share in the glory of the children of God. The word ‘glory’ is prominent, and hence the rendering ‘glorious liberty’ is unfortunate. The ‘glory’ is that spoken of in Romans 8:18, it will appear at the ‘revelation of the sons of God’ (Romans 8:19); in it the creation delivered from corruption will share. If the reference here were to the longings of heathen humanity alone, and not also to those of nature, Paul would have spoken more distinctly of the future conversion of the Gentiles.
