<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:22">Romans 8:22</span>. <strong> For we know. </strong> Here, as in chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:2">Romans 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:19">Romans 3:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:14">Romans 7:14</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:26">Romans 8:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28">Romans 8:28</span>, the Apostle appeals to the consciousness of <em> Christians, </em> rather than to the consciousness of all men. If <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:21">Romans 8:21</span> be taken as the purport of the hope, then this is a proof of the existence of the hope, and not of ‘the bondage of corruption.’ ‘For if that hope of glorious deliverance had not been left to it, <em> all </em> nature would not have united its groaning and travailing <em> until now. </em> This phenomenon, so <em> universal </em> and so <em> unbroken, </em> cannot be conduct without an aim; on the contrary, it presupposes as the motive of the painful travail that very hope, toward the final fulfilment of which it is directed’ (Meyer).

<p><strong> Groaneth together.</strong> The word ‘together’ must be repeated to bring out the sense. It refers to the common groaning of the whole creation, and should not be explained as ‘together with us’; this idea is first brought out in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23">Romans 8:23</span>.

<p><strong> Travaileth in pain together. </strong> The reference to birth-pangs suggests a new form of nature, to which this pain is the necessary preliminary.
	</p>
<p><strong> Until now, </strong> <em> i.e.</em>, the present moment; the idea of unbroken duration is the prominent one. There is no reference to some point of time in the future.
