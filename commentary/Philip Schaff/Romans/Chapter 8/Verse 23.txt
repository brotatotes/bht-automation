Romans 8:23.  And not only so.  Not only is this true, that the whole creation, etc.
	 But even we ourselves.  There are a number of slight variations in the Greek, but in any case a repetition of ‘ourselves’ brings out the correct emphasis. The reference is to Christians, possibly to the Christians of that time (see below). Even Christians who are highly privileged unite with creation in its groaning.
	 Though we have,  etc. This rendering is both more forcible and more grammatical.
	 The first-fruits of the Spirit.  ‘First-fruits  , ’   as a pledge of a full harvest. Explanations: (1.) The early Christians have the first fruits of the Spirit; the full harvest will be the impartation   of the Spirit to all Christians; (2.) what we now possess is but ‘first-fruits  , ’ the harvest will be the full outpouring in the future; (3.) the first-fruits of our redemption consist in the possession of the Holy Spirit. The reference to full glorification at the close of the verse makes (2.) slightly preferable; (3.) is the least probable view.
	 Even we ourselves groan within ourselves.  Though we have the first-fruits of the Spirit, our salvation is incomplete; the groaning is internal and intense.
	 Waiting for the adoption.  ‘Awaiting the fulness of our adoption’ (Alford). We are already adopted children (Romans 8:14-17), but the outward condition corresponding to this new relation is not yet complete.
	 The redemption of our body.  The redemption is not complete until the body  is  redeemed: then we shall have the full blessing of adoption. The explanation: ‘redemption from our body,’ is altogether incorrect, for the whole current of thought in this chapter places emphasis upon the glorification of the body at the coming of Christ (comp. Romans 8:11). The mention of the body confirms the view of ‘creation’ which refers it to material existences also; for the groaning in ourselves respects that part of our being which is most akin to the material creation.
