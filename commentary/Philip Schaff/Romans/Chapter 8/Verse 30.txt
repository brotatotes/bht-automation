Romans 8:30.  Them he also called. This certainly means more than the general invitation to believe and accept the gospel, since the series of gracious acts here announced does not include all who are thus invited. The call is effectual, is inseparably linked with predestination and justification in the unfolding of God’s gracious purpose. But the term is not identical with ‘effectually called,’ for the latter phrase emphasizes those subjective aspects which are left out of view here. The Apostle is not detailing our experience, but the acts of God which secure our salvation.
	 Them  he also justified.  Here, as elsewhere, accounted righteous. Only those who believe are justified, but as throughout the subjective side is not presented. The whole passage is for the comfort of those who believe.
