<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:31">Romans 8:31</span>. <strong> What then shall we say? </strong> In chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:5">Romans 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:1">Romans 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7">Romans 7:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:14">Romans 9:14</span>, this form introduces an inference which the Apostle opposes; here and in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:30">Romans 9:30</span>, one he accepts.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> These things; </strong> <em> i.e.,</em> set forth in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29-30">Romans 8:29-30</span>. What we should say is to echo the language of the rest of the chapter, which presents in glowing language the certainty of salvation as based upon the acts of Godâ€™s love in the facts of redemption.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> If God is for us,</strong> <strong> who is against us? </strong> This rendering is more literal. That God is for us, has already been shown (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29-30">Romans 8:29-30</span>); there is but one answer. But it is easier to accept the logic and admire the rhetoric of the passage, than to take the proper encouragement from it</p>
