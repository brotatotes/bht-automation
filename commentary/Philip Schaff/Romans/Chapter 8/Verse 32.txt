Romans 8:32.  He who, etc. This is an answer to the question of Romans 8:31; but as the great historical facts of the gospel now come into view, there is an advance in thought. The peculiar form of the original might be paraphrased: He who even, or, indeed.
	 Spared not. The negative side of what is positively stated in the next clause.
	 His own  son. This points to the only begotten Son (comp. Romans 8:3, where a similar expression occurs), to give emphasis to the display of love. Some find a contrast to adopted sons, but this is not necessarily involved.
	 Delivered him up.  The entire humiliation may be included, but the special reference to death is obvious; comp. chap. Romans 4:25.
	 For us all; all believers, since this class is referred to throughout. On the phrase, comp. chap. Romans 5:6-8.
	 How shall he not,  etc. An argument from the greater to the less; comp. chap. Romans 5:9-10.
	 With him also.  Some join ‘also’ with the verb, but in any case the fact that the gift of Christ  for  us is the gift of Christ  to us, forms the basis of the conclusion.
	 Freely give us all things.  Give as a matter of grace or favor, all those things already indicated in Romans 8:26-30, everything created that can work for good to us as those who are the objects of the love of God in Christ. This is the middle term which binds the two sides presented in Romans 8:28: ‘those who love God;’ ‘who are the called according to his purpose.’
