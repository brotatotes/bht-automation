<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"> God’s elect. Those referred to throughout, especially in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28-30">Romans 8:28-30</span>, thus designated to confirm the security of believers. Only believers can with any propriety find comfort in the thought, and even they should be careful not to rest their faith upon a decree of election rather than the personal Saviour.

<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> It is</strong> <strong> God that justifieth,</strong> or, ‘God is the justifier.’ If the common punctuation be accepted, this is the proof that no one can successfully accuse. If taken as a question, it is only a more rhetorical form of the same proof: ‘Shall God who justifieth?’ Meyer’s view, however, makes it the basis of the statement of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:34">Romans 8:34</span>: since it is God that justifieth, who is he that condemneth?</p>
