Romans 8:37.  Nay; literally, ‘but.’ Some connect this with Romans 8:35, making Romans 8:36 parenthetical, but this is not necessary, for the course of thought is unbroken, and this verse is antithetical to both Romans 8:35-36.
	 In all these things; just mentioned.
	 We are more than conquerors. A single word in the Greek: ‘over conquer;’ we are over-victorious. This tone of triumph is not selfish, for the abounding victory is through him who loved us. That the reference is to Christ, appears from the context Romans 8:35 (comp. Romans 8:39); from the tense used, which points to one crowning   act of love (comp. chap. Romans 5:6; Galatians 2:20), His death on the cross. Since His love conquered death, even in death we cannot be separated from His love, but are more than conquerors.
