<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:39">Romans 8:39</span>. <strong> Nor height, nor depth</strong>. The idea of space is now substituted for that of time; but it is difficult to define the exact reference. The most probable one is: heaven and hell; though heaven and earth, happiness and unhappiness, honor and shame, lofty and lowly, have been suggested. It is doubtful whether any specific definition is required.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Nor any other created thing.</strong> Whatever created being has not been previously included, is included here. The phrase seems to sum up rather than merely to supplement what precedes. The tone of the whole passage justifies the language of Meyer: ‘The attempt to bring the collective elements named in their consecutive order under definite <em> logical categories </em> leads to artificialities of exposition, which ought not to be applied to such enthusiastic outbursts of the moment’

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord</strong>. This is not to be distinguished from ‘the love of Christ’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:35">Romans 8:35</span>), since it is rather a fuller statement of the same love. ‘God is the original fountain, Christ the constant organ and mediating channel of one and the same love; so that in Christ is the love of God, and the love of God is the love of God in Christ’ (Meyer). Since God is above every created thing, since this love is ours, this completes the demonstration of the security of the believer. With this triumphant expression the Apostle closes his exposition of the main theme: the Gospel is to every one that believeth the power of God unto salvation: this it could not be if anything could separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Erasmus: ‘Cicero never said anything more eloquent.’
