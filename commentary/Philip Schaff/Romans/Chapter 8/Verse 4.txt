<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:4">Romans 8:4</span>. <strong> That the righteousness of the law. </strong> The word ‘righteousness’ is that used in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:16">Romans 5:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span>, in the sense of ‘righteous verdict,’ or, ‘righteous act,’ and in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:6">Luke 1:6</span>; chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:32">Romans 1:32</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:26">Romans 2:26</span>, in the <strong> </strong> sense of ‘ordinance,’ <em> i.e.,</em> righteous requirement. We explain it here as meaning ‘that righteous act (viewing all the acts as forming a unity) which meets the requirements of the law.’ Some would refer this to the imputation of Christ’s righteousness as the ground of our justification, but according to our view of the whole passage it means the actual holiness of the believer.

<p><strong> Might be fulfilled. </strong> The fulfilment is wrought by God, who sent his Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3">Romans 8:3</span>) and who sends His Spirit to fulfil this purpose of His grace.
	</p>
<p><strong> In us</strong>; not, ‘among us,’ nor, ‘through us,’ nor yet, ‘on us,’ but, ‘in us.’ This points to actual holiness; most of the other interpretations grow out of the reference to justification. The ideal aim of the Christian life is set forth.
	</p>
<p><strong> Who walk, </strong> etc. ‘Who are of such a kind as walk,’ etc. This part of the verse is an explanation of the character of those in whom the fulfilment takes place, and neither the result, nor the cause of what precedes.
	</p>
<p><strong> Not according to the flesh. </strong> Here, and in the rest of the section, ‘flesh’ has its strict ethical sense (see Excursus at close of chap. 7).
	</p>
<p><strong> According to the Spirit, </strong> <em> i.e.,</em> the Holy Spirit, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:2">Romans 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:5">Romans 8:5</span>. Others explain: the spiritual nature imparted by the Holy Spirit (the renewed nature); the subjective spiritual life-principle. Here especially any subjective sense is inappropriate, for ‘he walks <em> according </em> to the Spirit, who follows the guidance, the impelling and regulating power (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:2">Romans 8:2</span>), of the Holy Spirit’ (Meyer). A reference to the human spirit alone is preposterous, in view of the Pauline anthropology.
