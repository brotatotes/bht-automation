<p><strong> Doth not submit itself to the law of God. </strong> This fact, already set forth in the previous description of man (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:11">Romans 1:11</span>) and of the work of the law (chap. 7), shows that the enmity is not latent, but active.

<p><strong> Neither indeed can it. </strong> ‘For it is not even possible for it’ (Meyer). Paul declares that the cause of non-submission to the law of God, which is a proof of enmity to God, is the fact that the mind of the flesh has no ability to produce this submission, being essentially antagonism to God. Possibility of conversion and ability to believe are not under discussion; these imply the death of the flesh as a ruling principle.
