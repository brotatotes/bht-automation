<p>1. <em> The Life in the Spirit contrasted with the Life after the Flesh.
	</em></p>
<p>The Christian is free from condemnation (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:1">Romans 8:1</span>), because he is freed from the law of sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:2">Romans 8:2</span>), a result which the law could not accomplish, but which is accomplished by God through Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3-4">Romans 8:3-4</span>). Hence he lives according to the Spirit, not according to the flesh, for the former life is true life, the latter is death, and those who are in this condition cannot please God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:5-8">Romans 8:5-8</span>). The test of true spiritual life is the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, the pledge of the resurrection of our bodies (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9-11">Romans 8:9-11</span>). Therefore we ought not to live after the flesh, but through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the body (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:12-13">Romans 8:12-13</span>), being sons of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:14">Romans 8:14</span>), having the witness of the Spirit of adoption (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15-16">Romans 8:15-16</span>), and thus assured of the future glory which will follow the present suffering in fellowship with Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>).
