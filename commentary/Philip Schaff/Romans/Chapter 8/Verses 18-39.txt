 2. GROUNDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT, ATTESTING THE BELIEVER’S SECURITY.
	The life in the Spirit involves fellowship with Christ in suffering and glory (Romans 8:17). The sufferings are present, while the glory is yet future; but we are encouraged by the conviction that the glory will far outweigh the sufferings; the longing of the creation is an intimation that it will share in the full glorification which awaits us, and which we should wait for in patient hope (Romans 8:18-25). A further ground of encouragement is found in the sustaining presence of the Holy Spirit, interceding for us, and that too according to the will of the heart-searching God (Romans 8:26-27). Finally ‘we know that all things work together for good’ to Christians, designated as those who love God, and on the other hand as the called according to His purpose (Romans 8:28). Their security rests upon His  plan of salvation (Romans 8:29-30) on His love as proved by the saving  facts of the gospel (Romans 8:31-34) on the assurance that nothing can separate us from the love of Christ (Romans 8:35-37). The chapter closes with a triumphant expression of the Apostle’s personal confidence (Romans 8:38-39), forming a striking, appropriate, and triumphant conclusion to one of the most precious passages in the word of God.
