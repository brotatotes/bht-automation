<p><strong> 2. GROUNDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT, ATTESTING THE BELIEVER’S SECURITY.
	</strong></p>
<p>The life in the Spirit involves fellowship with Christ in suffering and glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>). The sufferings are present, while the glory is yet future; but we are encouraged by the conviction that the glory will far outweigh the sufferings; the longing of the creation is an intimation that it will share in the full glorification which awaits us, and which we should wait for in patient hope (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:18-25">Romans 8:18-25</span>). A further ground of encouragement is found in the sustaining presence of the Holy Spirit, interceding for us, and that too according to the will of the heart-searching God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:26-27">Romans 8:26-27</span>). Finally ‘we know that all things work together for good’ to Christians, designated as those who love God, and on the other hand as the called according to His purpose (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28">Romans 8:28</span>). Their security rests upon His <em> plan</em> of salvation (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29-30">Romans 8:29-30</span>) on His love as proved by the saving <em> facts</em> of the gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:31-34">Romans 8:31-34</span>) on the assurance that nothing can separate us from the love of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:35-37">Romans 8:35-37</span>). The chapter closes with a triumphant expression of the Apostle’s personal confidence (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:38-39">Romans 8:38-39</span>), forming a striking, appropriate, and triumphant conclusion to one of the most precious passages in the word of God.
