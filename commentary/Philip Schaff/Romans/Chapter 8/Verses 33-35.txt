Romans 8:33-35. The main point open to discussion is respecting the punctuation of these verses. ( 1 .) The E. V. gives answers as well as questions in Romans 8:33-34. ( 2 .) Others find two questions in each of these verses; so Augustine and many ancient and modern commentators. 3 . Meyer joins together the latter part of Romans 8:33-34, with the first clause of Romans 8:34-35 respectively: ‘Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth; who shall condemn? Christ (Jesus) is He that died, etc., who also maketh intercession for us; who shall separate us from the love of Christ?’ This view has much to recommend it, and is at least, preferable to the second one.
