Romans 9:15.  For he saith to Moses. An exact quotation from the LXX. (Exodus 33:19), giving part  of Jehovah’s answer to Moses, when on Mount Sinai, he said; ‘I beseech thee, show me thy glory.’ ‘In condescending to grant this request, the Lord would have him understand that nothing in him, notwithstanding all he had hitherto been able to do for the service of God, would merit such a favor. If God accorded it to him, it was not because it was Moses who besought Him, or had any right to it; it was pure grace on His part’ (Godet).
	 On whom I have  mercy. The present tense is used in this and the corresponding clause (‘I have compassion’), referring to the settled disposition of mercy and compassion. The word ‘whom’ in both instances might be rendered ‘whomsoever,’ and has an emphasis here, describing not merely the mercy, but the choice of the individual objects, as the free act of God
	 Have compassion is stronger than ‘have mercy;’ it ordinarily includes outward manifestations of compassion. The future tenses (‘will have mercy;’ ‘will have compassion’) point to the active exercise of God’s mercy and compassion.
