With this favorite expression, Paul introduces an inference from the passage cited: ‘In consequence of all this, it is proven that.’ The word to Moses is accepted as a divine axiom, and the inference is to be regarded as of universal validity, since neither the preceding context nor the scope of the argument suggests any limitation. ‘It is in parts of Scripture like this that we must be especially careful  not to fall short of what is written  not to allow of any compromise of the plain and awful words of God’s Spirit, for the sake of a caution which He Himself does not teach us’(Alford).
