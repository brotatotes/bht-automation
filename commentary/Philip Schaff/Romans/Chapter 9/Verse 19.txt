Romans 9:19.  Thou wilt say then unto me. This verse states a further objection, growing out (‘then’) of what has already been said. It is not necessary even here, where the answer is so sharply personal, to regard the objection as uttered by a Jew. For it will arise, wherever there is any such notion of God, however derived, as admits the possibility of His being the author of evil in man, or what amounts to the same thing, denies His righteousness, because there is a theoretical difficulty in reconciling our responsibility with His free will. The difficulty is an ontological one: Given an infinite free will, how can there be other free wills.
	 Why doth he yet find fault? Some good authorities insert ‘then,’ here also, referring to the previous discussion. ‘Yet,’ this being the case, that whom He will He hardens (Romans 9:18).
	 For who resisteth his will. The word is peculiar, meaning ‘the thing willed,’ but implying deliberation. ‘Resisteth’ is better than ‘hath resisted’; and the question implies the helpless ness of the objector, and acknowledges the Almightiness of God, but at the expense of His rectitude, since it virtually makes Him responsible for men’s sins.
