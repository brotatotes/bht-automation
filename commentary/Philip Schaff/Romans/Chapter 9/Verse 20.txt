<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:20">Romans 9:20</span>. <strong> Nay but</strong>. An unusual word, meaning, ‘Yes indeed;’ here used, either with a slight tone of irony, or, more probably, of indignant rebuke. ‘I do not examine the intrinsic verity of what you allege; but, be that as it may, this much is certain, that you are not in a position to dispute with God’(Godet).

<p style="margin-left:0.3em;"><strong> O man</strong>. This address suggests the contrast between man and God, afterwards brought out more fully.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.3em;"><strong> Who art thou</strong>. ‘How great art thou?’
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.3em;"><strong> That repliest against</strong> <strong> God</strong>. The peculiar word here used suggests an answer given to a previous response, <em> i.e.</em>, to God’s response (finding fault, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:19">Romans 9:19</span>) to man’s sin.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.3em;"><strong> Shall the thing formed</strong>, etc. We have here an echo of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+24:16">Isaiah 24:16</span> (not a quotation). ‘The thing formed,’ as a vessel is moulded. Hence the question has no reference to original creation, but to subsequent ethical moulding. The nature of the ‘clay’ and ‘lump’ is not yet suggested. The original indicates that a negative answer is expected.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.3em;"><strong> Why didst thou make me thus</strong>? The word ‘make’ in accordance with what precedes; is to be referred to preparing, adjusting, etc., not to creating. The folly, rather than the error of the objector, is thus rebuked.</p>
