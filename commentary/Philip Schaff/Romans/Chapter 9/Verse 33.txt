Romans 9:33.  As it is written, etc. Two passages from Isaiah are here combined.
	 Stone  of stumbling, etc. In Isaiah 8:14, God Himself is represented as being ‘for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence’ to His enemies.
	 This was properly applied to the Messiah by the Jews, and to our Lord by the Apostle. But he substitutes these expressions for similar ones in Isaiah 28:16, where the figure of a corner-stone occurs, applied by both Peter and Paul to Christ. This combination is both justifiable and natural. In both cases the supreme revelation of Jehovah in the Messiah is referred to; in one passage as a sanctuary for His people, but for a stone of stumbling, etc., to His enemies; in the other as a corner-stone laid in Zion, for a secure foundation.
	 He who believeth on him, etc. In chap. Romans 10:11 this clause is introduced again, but there ‘every one’ (E. V. incorrectly: ‘whosoever’) occurs, which is to be omitted here, according to the best authorities. In the LXX. it is not found; nor could it be emphatic here, since the antithesis to ‘stumbled’ makes ‘believeth’ the prominent word.
	 Shall not be put to shame. The Hebrew is: ‘shall not make haste,’ or, ‘flee hastily,’ with a primary reference to escaping from danger, but the LXX., from which Paul varies very slightly, gives the meaning with substantial correctness (comp. ‘confounded’ in the margin of the E. V.). This negative promise is rightly regarded as implying a positive blessing. ‘As though he had said: Because Christ is called the stone of stumbling, there is no reason that we should dread Him, for He is appointed for life to believers’ (Calvin).
