Romans 9:6.  But it is not so, that. The Apostle returns to the fact that the Jews rejected the gospel, and proceeds to account for it by stating that the promise holds good only for the true Israelites; a result indicated in the Scriptures. The opening clause, which is quite peculiar, means: ‘What I am saying is not of such a kind as to mean that,’ or, ‘the matter is not of such a kind that.’ The former sense would imply the latter. Whatever he says, he does not mean that  the word of God hath come to nought. The promise of God, as given in the Old Testament, has not ‘fallen to the ground,’ notwithstanding the unbelief of the Jews.
	 For not all who are of Israel (that is Israelites by birth)  are Israel, constitute the true Israel of God. The exact form of the original cannot be reproduced, but the meaning is unmistakable. The Apostle here presents the negative side of the idea already advanced in this Epistle (chap. Romans 4:12) and in Galatians 3:9, that physical relationship does not constitute membership in the true Israel.
