Romans 9:9.  For of promise is this word. We restore the emphatic order of the original. That ‘the children of the promise are reckoned as seed’ is proven, for the word, in accordance with which the birth of Isaac took place, this passage now cited, is a word of promise. (Not ‘was,’ for the reference is to an existent passage of Scripture.)
	 At this season, or, more literally, ‘according to this season.’ The passage is freely quoted from the LXX. (Genesis 18:10; Genesis 18:14). The Hebrew phrase rendered: ‘at this season,’ means when the time (shall be) reviving,’  i.e., at this season of the next year: so the LXX. substantially. ‘According to’ here suggests nothing more than ‘at.’
	 And Sarah shall have a son. From Genesis 18:14, substituted for a similar clause in Romans 9:10, because of the emphasis it gives (in the original) to the word ‘Sarah,’ who is the principal person (comp. Galatians 4:22, etc.).
