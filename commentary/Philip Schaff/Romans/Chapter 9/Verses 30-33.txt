 2. MANâ€™S RESPONSIBILITY: THE JEWS EXCLUDED THROUGH THEIR OWN UNBELIEF.
	For convenience we may divide this passage into two sections: (I.) Chap. Romans 9:30-33 sets forth the fact that the Jews had not attained to righteousness because they rejected God's way of obtaining it, namely, by faith. The responsibility for their rejection therefore rests upon themselves. (II.) The Apostle proceeds to lay emphasis upon this position, by proving that the Old Testament itself pointed to Christ as the end of the law, and to faith as the one way and the universal way of salvation; hence the unbelief of the Jews, in spite of the many prophetic warnings, left them without excuse, as a disobedient and gainsaying people; chap. Romans 10:1-21.
