Romans 1:5); and (2) the production in believers of  a full knowledge ( not ‘acknowledging’  ) of the truth, or entire Gospel revelation. A dual design: faith and knowledge. Against certain errorists, this truth tends to godliness, a Pauline word frequent in Pastoral Epistles, denoting that religious fear of God in the heart which penetrates and rules the whole conduct.
