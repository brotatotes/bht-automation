Titus 1:11.  Stopped; literally, muzzled; best done by exposing them as persons who ‘overturn entire houses,’  i.e.  families, through anarchic doctrine subversive of domestic authority: probably lax theories of Christian freedom in reference to wedlock and the duties of children and of slaves. Their motive was ‘base gain’ (better than ‘filthy lucre’)   to be won from their perverts.
