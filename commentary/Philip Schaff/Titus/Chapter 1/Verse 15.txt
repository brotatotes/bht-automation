Titus 1:15.  All things are pure for the pure;  for their use, that is. (Comp. our Lord, Matthew 15:10-20.) ‘Because created good by a good God, and because blessed by Him and sanctified by Christ, and because restored to man for his free use by Him’ (Wordsworth). When the morally  defiled are also unbelieving, they abide in their sin (John 8:24).
	 Nothing pure,  i.e.  to them; it ministers to the impurity of their own nature.
	 Mind and con-science describe the intellectual and the ethical side of the mind. False asceticism imputes un-cleanness to the mere use of material objects. Christianity teaches that all objects are antecedently and in themselves good; the polluted man makes this or that unclean to himself.
