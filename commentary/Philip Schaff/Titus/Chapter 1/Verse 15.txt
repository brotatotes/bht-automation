(Comp. our Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:10-20">Matthew 15:10-20</span>.) ‘Because created good by a good God, and because blessed by Him and sanctified by Christ, and because restored to man for his free use by Him’ (Wordsworth). When the morally <strong> defiled are also unbelieving</strong>, they abide in their sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:24">John 8:24</span>).

<p><strong> Nothing pure,</strong> <em> i.e. </em> to them; it ministers to the impurity of their own nature.

<p><strong> Mind and con-science</strong> describe the intellectual and the ethical side of the mind. False asceticism imputes un-cleanness to the mere use of material objects. Christianity teaches that all objects are antecedently and in themselves good; the polluted man makes this or that unclean to himself.
