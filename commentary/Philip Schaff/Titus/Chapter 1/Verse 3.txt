Titus 1:3. New construction begins. What is ‘manifested’ is not the ‘eternal life’ of Titus 1:2, but the ‘word.’ Yet the sense is the same: the Gospel is the final revelation of life eternal. Things promised are still in part concealed; performance alone is full manifestation.
	 Due times  (rather, ‘proper seasons’) denotes either, as in Galatians 4:4, an epoch in history when all things fitted, or at God’s own time. Former preferable. Read ‘our Saviour God,’ a phrase of the Pastoral Epistles (see marginal references). Saviour is applied elsewhere to God only in Luke 1:47 (with Old Testament reference) and Jude 1:25.
