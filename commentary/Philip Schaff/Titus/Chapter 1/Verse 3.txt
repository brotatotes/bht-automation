<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:3">Titus 1:3</span>. New construction begins. What is ‘manifested’ is not the ‘eternal life’ of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:2">Titus 1:2</span>, but the ‘word.’ Yet the sense is the same: the Gospel is the final revelation of life eternal. Things promised are still in part concealed; performance alone is full manifestation.

<p><strong> Due times </strong> (rather, ‘proper seasons’) denotes either, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span>, an epoch in history when all things fitted, or at God’s own time. Former preferable. Read ‘our Saviour God,’ a phrase of the Pastoral Epistles (see marginal references). Saviour is applied elsewhere to God only in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:47">Luke 1:47</span> (with Old Testament reference) and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:25">Jude 1:25</span>.
