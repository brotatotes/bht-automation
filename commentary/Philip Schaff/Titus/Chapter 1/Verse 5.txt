<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:5">Titus 1:5</span>. Note the importance of organization to preserve pure doctrine in the Church. It was part of the apostolic function to institute Church officers. Paul engaged in this when he left Crete. But the word <strong> ordain </strong> (used of deacons in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:3">Acts 6:3</span>) tells nothing of how the elders were selected or appointed.

<p><strong> Elders </strong> probably more than one <strong> in every city.</strong> [See Excursus on the Eldership.]
	</p>
<p><strong> As I had appointed, </strong> verbally, before leaving.
