In view of the prevailing Cretan immorality, unblemished reputation was wisely made the first qualification.

<p><strong> One wife. </strong> Is this against polygamy, or against second marriages, as most early fathers suppose, and <strong> </strong> as the ancient Church sanctioned by canon law? For the latter view, it is urged ( <em> a</em>) polygamy could hardly be forbidden here, since it was then illegal; ( <em> b</em>) <em> </em> the expression should in that case be negative (‘husband of no more than one’); ( <em> c</em>) <em> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:9">1 Timothy 5:9</span></em>, which is a parallel expression, can only refer to a second marriage; ( <em> d</em>) <em> </em> the feeling of antiquity was unfavourable to re-marriage. On the other hand, it is answered ( <em> a</em>) <em> </em> such a sense is but obscurely expressed by these words, for they have no necessary reference to any past condition of the candidate for eldership; ( <em> b</em>) <em> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:9">1 Timothy 5:9</span></em> is not parallel, since it expressly speaks of widows, but this not of widowers; and ( <em> c</em>) <em> </em> elsewhere Paul never forbids, but in certain cases (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:14">1 Timothy 5:14</span>) counsels re-marriage. Others conjecture a reference to re-marriage after divorce, or to conjugal infidelity; but these appear far-fetched. It is difficult to decide. Perhaps the safest course <strong> is </strong> to understand the injunction as simply requiring men to be chosen whose marriage relations had been at every point normal or unexceptionable, a condition not so easily realized in that age.

<p><strong> Faithful </strong> ( <em> i.e. </em> believing) children shews Christianity had for some time been professed in Crete. The succeeding words, <strong> not accused of </strong> dissolute-ness, or <strong> unruly </strong> against parental authority (comp-<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:4-5">1 Timothy 3:4-5</span>), describe the elder’s children.

<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:7">Titus 1:7</span> breaks into details the general word ‘blameless’ of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:6">Titus 1:6</span>: first giving as a reason for this qualification the nature of the office itself. Therefore he substitutes for the title elder or presbyter the more descriptive synonym <strong> bishop, </strong> or overseer. The elder’s function is to superintend the congregation, and be a <strong> steward </strong> or head servant over the house of God. Therefore he ought to be (1) not stubborn or unconciliatory; (2) not a hot-tempered man; or (3) loud over his cups; and (4) too ready with his fist. The three latter requirements describe one character, and give a low idea of the Cretan Christians. Also (5) not abusing his office for gain (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8">1 Timothy 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:2">1 Peter 5:2</span>), as Paul accuses the heretics of doing, see below, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:11">Titus 1:11</span>.
