Titus 2:12. The design of the Gospel epiphany of grace was to tutor or discipline men into virtue. The word  teaching comprehends all methods of training as applied to a child, correction not excluded. God’s grace in Christ is pædagogic, disciplinary, practical. Hence the false teachers of Crete were condemned as heretics by their evil practice. The end or design of such discipline is given negatively and positively: (1) ‘Having denied’ the old unconverted life on its Godward side (=  ungodliness) and also on its earthward (=‘cosmic or secular desires,’ such as pertain to the fallen ‘world,’ see 1 John 2:15), we should (2) live (  a)   with due control over ourselves (soberly, as in Titus 2:4; Titus 2:6), and (  b)   with due regard for others’ rights (‘justly’), and (  c)   with due piety or devotedness to the Divine honour (  godly opposed to  ungodliness).
