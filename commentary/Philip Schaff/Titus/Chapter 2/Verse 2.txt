<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:2">Titus 2:2</span>. <strong> Sober </strong> is best taken literally; parallel to ‘not given to much wine’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:3">Titus 2:3</span>. Drunkenness was a Cretan failing, and the old were especially liable to it

<p><strong> Grave,</strong> ‘reverend or worshipful’ (Wordsworth), misrendered ‘honest’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+4:8">Philippians 4:8</span>.

<p><strong> Temperate,</strong> same word as ‘sober’ of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:8">Titus 1:8</span>, indicates wise self-control. The next words apply the idea of moral sanity and holiness to the three cardinal Christian graces; only for ‘hope’ is here put that brave endurance to the end under trial which is the practical fruit of hope, and appropriate in aged disciples.
