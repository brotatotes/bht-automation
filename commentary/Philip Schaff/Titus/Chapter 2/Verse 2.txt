	 Temperate, same word as ‘sober’ of Titus 1:8, indicates wise self-control. The next words apply the idea of moral sanity and holiness to the three cardinal Christian graces; only for ‘hope’ is here put that brave endurance to the end under trial which is the practical fruit of hope, and appropriate in aged disciples.
