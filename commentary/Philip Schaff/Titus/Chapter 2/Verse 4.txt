<p><strong> Teach, </strong> better ‘school,’ so to discipline as to bring one to practical wisdom. The virtues in which young married women need to be schooled follow: the virtues of home life.

<p><strong> Discreet</strong> is the word rendered ‘temperate’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:2">Titus 2:2</span>, and ‘sober-minded’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:6">Titus 2:6</span>. Better to retain the same rendering throughout, where the term is so characteristic See on ‘sober’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:8">Titus 1:8</span>.
