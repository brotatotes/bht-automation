<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:14">Titus 2:14</span>. <strong> For us,</strong> on our behalf. The design of Christ’s self-offering to death was a moral one
	</p>
<p>to set us free by payment of a ransom-price (see the root text in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span>) from iniquity (or sin viewed as lawlessness, comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:3-4">1 John 1:3-4</span>). The principle of lawless living is thought of as a tyrannical usurper over human nature. Its hold is broken when the price is paid for the slave that price the ‘precious blood,’ as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:18-19">1 Peter 1:18-19</span>. The redeeming act which is past describes one side of salvation. Another follows in the cleansing of the redeemed: <strong> purify to himself</strong> a people who shall be His own private possession; so <strong> peculiar</strong> means here a much misused expression. The phrase is from the Pentateuch; see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:5">Exodus 19:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+26:18">Deuteronomy 26:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+26:18">Deuteronomy 26:18</span>. In New Testament, the only parallel is <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>, where, however, the word is different. The ethical design of this redemption, which is also a cleansing of His people, becomes again emphatic in the last clause ( <strong> zealous of good works</strong>), recurring to the radical idea (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:12">Titus 2:12</span>) that the Gospel revelation of grace contemplates as its aim a holy life. On general thought compare <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:0">Romans 6:0</span>

<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:15">Titus 2:15</span> reverts at the close to the opening of the section in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:1">Titus 2:1</span>. Titus is to teach ( <strong> speak</strong>), and also to urge to duty ( <strong> exhort</strong>), and also convict (or <strong> rebuke</strong>) the disobedient after a fashion so vigorous and bold that no man in Crete shall undervalue him. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:12">1 Timothy 4:12</span>.

<p><strong> Authority</strong> <strong> is</strong> here ‘imperativeness’ of manner (Alford). </p>
