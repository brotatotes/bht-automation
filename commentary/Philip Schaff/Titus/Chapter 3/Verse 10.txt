<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:10">Titus 3:10</span>. Thus far of Titus’ attitude to the errors; now, to the errorists. In Paul’s sense, heretic comes nearer schismatic than what we now describe by the word. As in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:19">1 Corinthians 11:19</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:20">Galatians 5:20</span>, so here, he speaks of making party factions to divide the Church, rather than of false doctrine. Most divisions have their root in self-will, but do not necessarily involve fundamental error. The word admonition covers every kind of earnest endeavour to bring the sectary to a better mind. Failing that, after two attempts, he was to be ‘shunned’ (reject) probably in personal intercourse; possibly referring to church censure. The wisest measures may fail to hinder scandalous schisms in the Church.
