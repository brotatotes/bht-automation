<p><strong> Tychicus</strong>, of the province of Asia (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>), who carried from Rome the letters to Colosse (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:7-8">Colossians 4:7-8</span>), and to Ephesus (so called; see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:21-22">Ephesians 6:21-22</span>). In his second imprisonment, Paul again sent him to Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:12">2 Timothy 4:12</span>). There were various cities called Nicopolia. Paul is supposed to mean the town in Epirus founded in memory of the battle of Actium on the Spot where the army of Augustus halted. Though only thirty years old at this time, it was the chief town in Western Greece. Probably it was there, during approaching winter, that Paul was arrested and sent to Rome for the last time.
