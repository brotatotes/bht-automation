<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:2">Titus 3:2</span>. Duty to general (heathen) society. The general idea is, for the rude violence customary in Crete to show the gentle and patient and kindly spirit characteristic of the Gospel.
	</p>
<p><strong> Meekness </strong> is the social grace of character that results from religious brokenness of spirit; shows itself in abusing none in words, not being prompt to quarrel (like the low population of Cretan seaports), but rather giving way to the insolence of others.
