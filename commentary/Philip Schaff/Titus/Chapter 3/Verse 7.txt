<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:7">Titus 3:7</span>. Design of the Spirit-baptism is to make sons of God, therefore heirs, of those who have been justified by His (that is, God’s) grace. The filial standing and character of believers are by Paul uniformly connected with the gift of the Holy Ghost (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span>). The inheritance conforms to the ‘hope’ referred to at the outset in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:2">Titus 1:2</span>. It is the ‘promised inheritance’ reserved for the ‘seed’ (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:16-19">Galatians 3:16-19</span>). It is characteristic of Paul, that, beginning with a practical admonition, he should run it back to the rich doctrines of Gospel grace and the highest privileges of the children of God.
