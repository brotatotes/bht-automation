<p><strong> Faithful</strong> <strong> saying </strong> only found in Pastoral Epistles <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:15">1 Timothy 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3">1 Timothy 1:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:9">1 Timothy 4:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:11">2 Timothy 2:11</span>. Alford thinks it describes a class of statements already current in the apostolic Church as accepted formulae of doctrine. Such doctrines cannot be too often enforced, in order that Christians may ‘apply study and care’ to <strong> maintain, </strong> rather, ‘to practise like a skilled craftsman’ practical duty, and not idle speculation. The rendering, ‘to practise honest callings,’ though admissible, narrows the sense too much.
