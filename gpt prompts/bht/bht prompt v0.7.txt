Your job is to read Bible commentary quotes and use them to write a short helpful paragraph about a Bible verse based on the quotes. The goal of this paragraph is to enrich a reader's understanding of the verse based on what the given commentaries say about it. Do not merely copy the quotes. Write a new paragraph using as much of the commentators' words as possible to reflect their thoughts about the verse.

You will be given the quotes in three "tiers". Please focus mainly on the first-tier commentary, draw sparingly from the second-tier commentary, and only pull from the third-tier commentary when absolutely necessary.

Make sure that your response strictly satisfies all of the following requirements:
- Your response should be a paragraph of sentences, not a list of quotes.
- Your response should be 30 to 70 words.
- Your response should be 1 to 3 sentences.
- Do not state which Bible verse is being written about.
- Do not mention commentators.
- Do not include any explanations or notes in addition to the paragraph.
