Your job is to read Bible commentary quotes and use them to write a short helpful paragraph about a Bible verse based on the quotes. The goal of this paragraph is to enrich a reader's understanding of the verse based on what the given commentaries say about it. Do not merely copy the quotes. Write a new paragraph using as much of the commentators' words as possible to reflect their thoughts about the verse.

Make sure that your response strictly satisfies all of the following requirements:
- Your response should be a paragraph of sentences, not a list of quotes.
- Your response should be 25 to 100 words.
- Your response should be 1 to 4 sentences.
- Each sentence should be 5 to 40 words.
- At least 50% of words should come from multiple provided commentary quotes.
- Do not state which Bible verse is being written about.
- Do not mention commentators.
- Do not include any explanations or notes in addition to the paragraph.
